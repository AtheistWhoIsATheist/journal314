f the other. The other calls the tune to one’s eligibility for immortality, and so the other takes up one’s unlived life. Relationship is thus always slavery of a kind, which leaves a residue of guilt.” (a limiting of freedom as necessary with relationships)

- “To judge by his own self-accusations of worthlessness, the patient feels an immense burden of guilt.”
- “The depressed person exaggerates his guilt because it unblocks his dilemma in the safest and easiest way.  He also, as Adler pointed out, gets the people around him to respond to him, to pity him, and to value him and take care of him.  He controls them and heightens his own personality by his very self-pity and self-hatred.” (how does he not do this if a person conscious of the human condition would 'most definitely go mad'?)
- on the schizophrenic- “There is a type of person for whom life is a more insurmountable problem than for others, for whom the burden of anxiety and fear is almost as constant as his daily breath. Rank used the term “neurotic” for one type of person who was without illusion, who saw things as they were, who was overwhelmed by the fragility of the human enterprise; and in this sense the term describes perfectly the schizophrenic type. He is the “realist” that William James talked about when he said that the right reaction to the horrors of organismic life on this planet is the psychotic one.”
- “Adler very early showed how the schizophrenic was crippled by the fear of life and its demands, by a low self-evaluation in the face of them. He mistrusts not only himself but also the knowledge
and ability of others; nothing seems to him to be able to overcome the inevitable horrors of life and death—except perhaps the fantastic ideational system that he fabricates for his own salvation.” (Ha! That sounds just like me and haas)
- “I mean the fact that human experience is split into two modes—the symbolic self and the physical body—and that these two modes of experience can be quite distinct. In some people they are so distinct as to be unintegrated, and these are the people we call schizophrenic. The hypersensitive individual reacts to his body as something strange to himself, something utterly untrustworthy, something not under his secure control.  Right away we can see that the schizophrenic is burdened, like all of us, with an “alien” animal body.”  (this took a while to understand? This sounds like 'science fiction' to others? Ha!)
- “By pushing the problem of man to its limits, schizophrenia also reveals the nature of creativity. If you are physically unprogrammed in the cultural causa-sui project, then you have to invent your own: you don’t vibrate to anyone else’s tune. You see that the fabrications of those around you are a lie, a denial of truth—a truth that usually takes the form of showing the terror of the human condition more fully than most men experience it. The creative person becomes, then, in art, literature, and religion the mediator of natural terror and the indicator of a new way to triumph over it. He reveals the darkness and the dread of the human condition and fabricates a
new symbolic transcendence over it. This has been the function of the creative deviant from the shamans through Shakespeare.”
- “But if the neurotic is the “artiste manque,” what is the schizophrenic who has no talent, who is not creative? He must be a completely inverted and pathetic failure, as the wards in our mental
hospitals attest. An impoverished and powerless person—even when he is a perceiver of truth—has no gift to offer to his fellows or to himself. The uncreative psychotic is simply totally crippled by life-and-death fears.”  (I always wanted to be more creative. This would make the earthly world easier; and who says that an 'easier' existence is to be pursued?  To avoid pain and fear?  Ha!  Weak and  pathetic us human creatures are!  Avoid because I don't like feeling a particular way.  Just an arbitrary sensation?  Naturalism)
- “The schizophrenic is not programmed neurally into automatic response to social meanings, but he cannot marshal an ego response, a directive control of his experiences. His own erupting meanings cannot be given any creative form. We might say that because of his exaggerated helplessness he uses his symbolic inner experiences alone as an experiential anchor, as something to lean on. He exists reflexively toward them, comes to be controlled by them instead of reshaping and using them. The genius too is not programmed in automatic cultural meanings; but he has
the resources of a strong ego, or at least a sufficient one, to give his own personal meanings a creative form.”
- “In schizophrenia, like depression, we see the problem of heroics in its stark nudity. How does one become a hero from a position in which he has hardly any resources at all?—a position from which he sees more clearly than anyone else the menacing dangers of life and death and yet has no solid feeling of inner glory to oppose to them? He has to fabricate such a feeling in the best way he can, which will be a clumsy, crippled, and inverted way. No wonder that psychotic transferences are so total, so intense, so all-absorbing, so frightening (when they are not pathetic).”
- 
- “All perversions, then, can truly be seen as 'private religions,' as attempts to heroically transcend the human condition and to achieve some kind of satisfaction in that condition. That is why perverts are forever saying how superior and life-enhancing their particular approach is, how they cannot understand why anyone would not prefer it. It is the same sentiment that animates all true believers, the trumpeting of who is the true hero and what is the only genuine
path to eternal glory.”  (I agree. Tillich on the importance and necessity of doubt in faith, on the importance of not idolizing the 'concrete' symbols of faith)
- “The religious geniuses of history have argued that to be really submissive means to be submissive to the highest power, the true infinity and absolute—and not to any human substitutes, lovers, leaders, nationstates.”  (Vivekananda, Tolstoy, Tillich, Cioran)
- “From this point of view the problem of mental illness is one of not knowing what kind of heroics one is practising or not being able—once one does know—to broaden ones heroics from their crippling narrowness. Paradoxical as it may sound, mental illness is thus a matter of weakness and stupidity.” (Ha!)
- “All living organisms are condemned to perversity, to the narrowness of being mere fragments of a larger totality that overwhelms them, which they cannot understand or truly cope with—yet must still live and struggle in. We still must ask, then, in the spirit of the wise old Epictetus, what kind of perversity is fitting for man.”
Start of Chapter 11-
- “When we are young we are often puzzled by the fact that each person we admire seems to have a different version of what life ought to be, what a good man is, how to live, and so on. If we are
especially sensitive it seems more than puzzling, it is disheartening.” (this is the absurd perspective, the problem of relativism/nihilism that is not seen by every one because they have been raised within the relativistic/nihilistic framework, nothing weird about everyone having a different opinion/not being able to find out who's right, if anyone is, and yet not figuring out that all your moral/important demands and judgments are just as nonsensical as the person that you oppose, since there is no way to find out who is right, how come everyone doesn't find this weird?)
- Freud's quote- “I have found little that is "good” about human beings on the whole.  In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or none at all...If we are to talk of ethics, I subscribe to a high ideal from which most of the human beings I have come across depart most lamentably.”
- on Freud, but relevant to almost all people today- “He could not yield emotionally to superordinate power or conceptually to the transcendental dimension. He lived still wholly in the dimension of the visible world and was limited by what was possible in that dimension only; therefore, all his meanings had to come from that dimension.”
- on the knight of faith- “He accepts whatever happens in this visible dimension without complaint, lives his life as a duty, faces his death without a qualm. No pettiness is so petty that it threatens his meanings; no task is too frightening to be beyond his courage. He is fully in the world on its terms and wholly beyond the world in his trust in the invisible dimension. It is very much the old Pietistic ideal that was lived by Kants parents. The great strength of such an ideal is that it allows one to be open, generous, courageous, to touch others' lives and enrich them and open them in turn. As the knight of faith has no fear-of-life-and- death trip to lay onto others, he does not cause them to shrink back upon themselves, he does not coerce or manipulate them. The knight of faith, then, represents what we might call an ideal of mental health, the Continuing openness of life out of the 'death throes of dread'.”  (jesus, no wonder Kierkegaard said he could never become the knight of faith.  This faith is Vivekananda's mystical experience through meditation, or the optimistic way in which Vivekananda sometimes talks, it is not something that Tillich, Kierkegaard, or Vivekananda (in half or more of his moods/writings think is sustianable, i.e. the experience of Meaninglessness/Nihilism is the stronger, more true, experience, which did not allow for Kierkegaard to obtain this 'ideal of mental health', anxiety never leaves the creaturely human, no matter how 'holy' he thinks he has become. i.e. the finite/infinite gap)
- the selflessness of Vivekananda, the knight of faith for Kierkegaard are not possible, the experience of meaninglessness trumps these ideals, or the attitudes/psychological states that are needed to be obtain by a particular human, which make the ideals impossible- “Put in these abstract terms the ideal of the knight of faith is surely one of the most beautiful and challenging ideals ever put forth by man.  It is contained in most religions in one form or another although no one, I think, has described it at length with such talent at Kierkegaard.  Like all ideals it is a creative illusion, meant to lead men on, and leading men on is not the easiest tiling.  As Kierkegaard said, faith is the hardest thing; he placed himself between belief and faith, unable to make the jump. The jump doesn't depend on man after all—-there's the rub: faith is a matter of grace. As Tillich later put it: religion is first an open hand to receive gifts (grace) and then a closed hand to give them.”
- “For every shortcoming that we can point to in Freud, we can find a corresponding one in Kierkegaard. If Freud can be said to have erred on the side of the visible, then Kierkegaard can surely be said to have equally erred on the side of the invisible. He turned away from life partly from his fear of life, he embraced death more easily because he had failed in life; his own life was not a voluntary sacrifice undertaken in free will, but a pathetically driven sacrifice. He did not live in the categories in which he thought.” (my mother asked me if I put people into 'categories', this makes me think of how I do that.  I see how self-aware a person is.  That says a lot, since the more self-aware, the 'further along' a person is)
- “I am talking matter-of-factly about some of the surest giants in the history of humanity only to say that in the game of life and death no one stands taller than any other, unless it be a true saint,
and only to conclude that sainthood itself is a matter of grace and not of human effort. My point is that for man not everything is possible. What is there to choose between religious creatureliness
and scientific creatureliness? The most one can achieve is a certain relaxedness, an openness to experience that makes him less of a driven burden on others. And a lot of this depends on how much talent he has, how much of a daimonis driving him; it is easier to lay down light burdens than heavy ones. How does a man create from all his living energies a system of thought, as Freud did, a system directed wholly to the problems of this world, and then just give it up to the invisible one? How, in other words, can one be a saint and still organize scientific movements of world-historical importance? How does one lean on God and give over everything to Him and still stand on his own feet as a passionate human being?  These are not rhetorical questions, they are real ones that go right to the heard of the problem of 'how to be a man'- a problem that no one can satisfactorily advise anyone else on, as the wise William James knew. The whole thing is loaded with ambiguity impossible to resolve.” (this is the issue of non-movement.  What does a person do with this knowledge? Create something, e.g. art, science, etc.?  And is that enough?  It cannot be. Robin Williams.  That keeps a person alive, it gives them a temporarily satisfactory illusion of meaning in thir pathetic earthly lives.  The person who has no creative outlet, or the person who loses interest/sees through the transitory illusion of meaning of ones 'interest', i.e. the arbitrary nature of pursuing one thing over the other, enjoying one thing over another, the idea of wanting this over that, the issue of deciding for this and therefore against that, and so on.  Choose.  Choose, go ahead.  And, now: Why?  Why that?  Why not this?  Or that over there?  “Because you wanted to”, you say?  “Because you felt like it”?)
- “...led Tillich to argue so penetratingly that Eastern mysticism is not for Western man. It is an evasion of the courage to be; it prevents the absorption of maximum meaninglessness into oneself.  Tillich s point is that mystical experience seems to be near to perfect faith but is not. Mysticism lacks precisely the element of skepticism, and skepticism is a more radical experience, a more manly confrontation of potential meaninglessness. Even more, we must not forget that much of the time, mysticism as popularly practised is fused with a sense of magical omnipotence: it is actually a manic defense and a denial of creatureliness.” (Tillich pg. 178)
- “James, again, knew how difficult it was to live astride both worlds, the visible and the invisible. One tended to pull you away from the other.” (the divided-self, double-mindedness)
- “And then the real tragedy, as Andre Malraux wrote in The Human Condition: that it takes sixty years of incredible suffering and effort to make such an individual and then he is good only for dying.  This painful paradox is not lost on the person himself least of all himself. He feels agonizingly unique, and yet he knows that this doesn’t make any difference as far as ultimates are concerned.  He has to go the way of the grasshopper, even though it takes longer.” (Ha!)
- “Finally, with these questions we saw that we could call into doubt the pretensions of the whole therapeutic enterprise. What joy and comfort can it give to fully awakened people? Once you
accept the truly desperate situation that man is in, you come to see not only that neurosis is normal, but that even psychotic failure represents only a little additional push in the routine stumbling
along life’s way. If repression makes an untenable life liveable, self-knowledge can entirely destroy it for some people.”
- Not everyone is as honest as Freud was when he said that he cured the miseries of the neurotic only to open him up to the normal misery of life.” (Ha!)
- “I have never seen or heard them communicate the dangers of the total liberation that they
claim to offer; say, to put up a small sign next to the one advertising joy, carrying some inscription like “Danger: real probability of the awakening of terror and dread, from which there is no turning back.” It would be honest and would also relieve them of some of the guilt of the occasional suicide that takes place in therapy.”  (Camus: 'a man who is conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it', listen to a ton of Mckenna before a psychedelic trip, Huxley)
- “As in any religion, the adept “swears by” it because he has lived it; the therapy is “true” because it is a lived experience explained by concepts that seem perfectly to fit it, that give form to what the patient actually is undergoing.” (is this what I am doing here?)
- “It is no wonder that when therapies strip man down to his naked aloneness, to the real nature of experience and the problem of life, they slip into some kind of metaphysic of power and justification
from beyond. How can the person be left there trembling and alone? Offer him the possibility of mystical contact with the void of creation, the power of “It,” his likeness to God, or at the very
least the support of a guru who will vouch for these things in his own overpowering and harmonious-appearing person. Man must reach out for support to a dream, a metaphysic of hope that sustains him and makes his life worthwhile.”
- “To talk about hope is to give the right focus to the problem. It helps us understand why even the thinkers of great stature who got at the heart of human problems could not rest content with the view of the tragical nature of man’s lot that this knowledge gives,. It is today well known how
Wilhelm Reich continued the Enlightenment in the direction of a fusion of Freud with Marxistzs social criticism, only to reach finally for Orgone, the primal cosmic energy. Or how Jung wrote an intellectual apologia for the text of ancient Chinese magic, the I Ching.  In this, as Rieff has so bitingly argued, these men are of lesser stature than their master the great Stoic Freud.” (why people 'ignore' or 'talk around' the consequences of Nihilism, Skepticism, etc.  this is a true sense of awe or, more so, terror.  It's 'too much' even for these' strong men', Ha!  The knight of faith, Tillich's 'Courage' is all a sham)
- “How can a self-conscious creature change the dilemma of his existence? There is simply
no way to transcend the limits of the human condition or to change the psychological structural conditions that make humanity possible.   What can it mean for something new to emerge from such an animal and to triumph over his nature? Even though men have repeated such a notion since the most ancient times and in the most subtle and weightiest ways, even though whole movements of social action as well as thought have been inspired by such ideas, still they are mere fancy...”
- “Consider Paul Tillich: he too had his metaphysic of New Being, the belief in the emergence of a new type of person who would be more in harmony with nature, less driven, more perceptive, more in touch with his own creative energies, and who might go on to form genuine communities to replace the collectivities of our time, communities of truer persons in place of the objective creatures created by our materialistic culture. But Tillich had fewer illusions about this New Being than most of the psychotherapeutic religionists. He saw that the idea was actually a myth, an ideal that might be worked toward and so partly realized.”(the knight of faith myth, the selflessness myth, getting 'beyond' the terror of existence, if rightfully understood, is not possible, only with repressions, distractions, diversions, can humans cope with living this existence)
- “If you are going to have a myth of New Being, then, like Tillich, you have to use this myth as a call to the highest and most difficult effort—and not to simple joy. A creative myth is not simply a relapse into comfortable illusion; it has to be as bold as possible in order to be truly generative.” (Vivekananda, this is why Nihilism is God, reality cannot be what brings us pleasure, what a silly earthly ideal, pathetic)
- “What singles out Tillich’s cogitations about the New Being is that there is no nonsense here. Tillich means that man has to have the “courage to be” himself, to stand on his own feet, to face up to the eternal contradictions of the real world. The bold goal of this kind of courage is to absorb into ones own being the maximum amount of nonbeing. As a being, as an extension of all of Being, man has an organismic impulsion: to take into his own organization the maximum amount of the problematic of life. His daily life, then, becomes truly a duty of cosmic proportions, and his courage to face the anxiety of meaninglessness becomes a true cosmic heroism.”  (Kierkegaard, Vivekananda)
- “The problem of meaninglessness is the form in which nonbeing poses itself in our time...”
- “Again, we are talking about the highest ideal things, which always seem most unreal—but how can we settle for less? We need the boldest creative myths, not only to urge men on but also and
perhaps especially to help men see the reality of their condition. We have to be as hard-headed as possible about reality and possibility.” (Tillich's symbolism, Vivekananda's praise of having many sects of religion, etc.)
- “As Tillich warned us, New Being, under the conditions and limitations of existence, will only bring into play new and sharper paradoxes, new tensions, and more painful disharmonies—a “more intense demonism.” Reality is remorseless because gods do not walk upon the earth; and if men could become noble repositories of great gulfs of nonbeing, they would have even less peace than we oblivious and driven madmen have today.”
- “It is this therapeutic megalomania that must quickly been seen through if we are not to be perfect fools. The empirical facts of the world will not fade away because one has analyzed his
Oedipus complex, as Freud so well knew, or because one can make love with tenderness, as so many now believe. Forget it. In this sense again it is Freuds somber pessimism, especially of his later writings such as Civilization and Its Discontents, that keeps him so contemporary. Men are doomed to live in an overwhelmingly tragic and demonic world.” (Zapffe and 'Happiness is for the pigs')
- “I think that taking life seriously means something such as this: that whatever man does on
this planet has to be done in the lived truth of the terror of creation, of the grotesque, of the rumble of panic underneath everything.  Otherwise it is false.” (Tillich, which is why 'mysticism' is not the 'stopping point', it is a guide, but it does not overpower the experience of Meaninglessness, Nihilism)

1. Paul Tillich
Dynamics of Faith

- “Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned.”
- speaking of in the Old Testament- “They state unambiguously the character of genuine faith, the demand of total surrender to the subject of ultimate concern.” (this seems important, since is this an 'ideal' like Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith or Vivekananda's complete selflessness? Is it something that cannot seemingly be reached, but must still be thrived towards?  Is this what martrys are doing?  Suicides too?  It seems that they are ultimately surrendering.  What about Muslim 'terrorists'?  Of course they would be celebrated under other value structures that begin with Islam being the ultimate concern.  I know that's too vague to say that all 'islam' would resort to this, but 'terrorism' does seem justified as an ultimate concern)
- “...the ultimate concern with 'success' and the social standing and economic power. It is the god of many people in the highly competitive western culture...even if the price is sacrifice of genuine human relations, personal conviction, and creative eros...misplaced faith is...When fulfilled, the promise of this faith proves to be empty.”
- “Faith is not an act of any of his rational functions, as it is not an act of the unconscious, but it is an act in which both the rational and the nonrational elements of his being are transcended...It transcends them, but it does not destroy them. (Otto)
- “'Ecstasy' means standing 'outside of oneself'- without ceasing to be oneself. (One of the Nihilist speaks of the objectivity one gets from Nihilism, I say this in my journals, I just need to find the entry date, also that quote from 'solitude' is exactly this experience.  Although all alone, you have a sense of something bigger that is connected with yourself and everyone else, Shrooms, cannabis, entheogens)
- “The reality of man's ultimate concern reveals something about his being, namely, that he is able to transcend the flux of relative and transitory experiences of his ordinary life.”
- “Man's experiences feelings, thoughts are conditioned and finite.  They not only come and go, but their content is of finite and conditional concern...”
- “Man is driven towards faith by his awareness of the infinite.” (Zapffe and his term 'transcendental yearning', Vivekananda saying nothing will make us ultimately content in this world of Maya)
- Faith- “...is the passion for the infinite.”
- Ultimate Concern- “...the ultimate is concern about what is experienced as ultimate.”
- In reference to 'idols' which Tillich claims everything under the sun has been use as the 'ultimate' in religious history- “...a critical principle was and is at work in man's religious consciousness, namely, that which is really ultimate over against what claims to be ultimate but is only preliminary, transitory, finite.” (symbolism, the ultimate concern is supposed to 'unite' the subjective, human world, with the objective, infinite realm of Divinity, according to Tillich)
- “There is no faith without a content toward which it is directed.”
- “All speaking about divine matters which is not done in the state of ultimate concern is meaningless.”  (if there is speak about the worldly, then it is meaningless with regards to the divine, which is why I find philosophy/abstractness to be a decently accurate symbol for speaking or thinking about God)
- “In true faith the ultimate concern is a concern about the truly ultimate; while in idolatrous faith preliminary, finite realities are elevated to the rank of ultimacy.  The inescapable consequence of idolatrous faith is 'existential disappointment,' a disappointment which penetrates into the very existence of man!”  (anything worldly must not be given any more value than a symbol, as a pretending to bridge the gap of the finite and the infinite. The disconnect, the doubt, the meaningless is always here, it is never overcome.  The ones who have 'overcome' are the ones who have mistakenly, whether out of fear or just ignorance, elevated the finite to the level of the infinite.  They are idolatrous.  Augustine makes this finite/infinite distinction very clearly.  As does Kierkegaard and the mystics who hold that even the humans who don't recognize it, are stuck in the nightmare of existence, the human condition is universal)
- “...even an idolatrous faith can hide this consequence only for a certain time. But finally it breaks into the open.”  (Nihilism, meaninglessness, will come through, eventually, hopefully.  A man only comes to religion when the patchwork does not hold anymore.  When everything comes crashing.
- “The awareness of the holy is awareness of the presence of the divine, namely of the content of our ultimate concern.”
- “It is a presence that remains mysterious in spite of its appearance, and it exercises both an attractive and a repulsive function of those who encounter it.”
- “The human heart seeks the infinite because that is where the finite wants to rest.  In the infinite it sees its own fulfillment.”
- “...the infinite distance of the finite from the infinite and, consequently, the negative judgment over any finite attempts to reach the infinite.  The feeling of being consumed in the presence of the divine is a profound expression of man's relation to the holy.”  (this is experienced in the mushroom trip. This experience of utter separation from the Divine, yet when on psylocibin, having a true sense of Humility in the face of something truly Other.  This whole of love takes you from everything, even yourself, yet even though 'you' disintegrates, you are still 'there' somehow.  All does become One.  Such a counter experience from anything 'rational', anything our 'normal', boring, obnoxiously vain produces. This is not a philosophical argument, it's a call for experience.  This cannot be logic chopped.  The experience happened.  The experience was real to me.  TO ME, it's real.  Now what do I do with that? Ha!)
- “'Holy' has become identified with moral perfection...Originally, the holy has meant what is apart from the ordinary realm of things and experiences.
- “Entering the sanctuary means encountering the holy.:
- “...the holy has been called the 'entirely other'...”
- “The holy transcends this realm; this is its mystery and its unapproachable character.”
- “...there is no way of reaching the infinite.” (necessarily its symbolism)
- “The holy can appear as creative and as destructive.”
- “...the terrifying and consuming element can be destructive and creative.”
- “...the concept of the holy was changed.  Holiness becomes justice and truth.  It is creative and not destructive.  The true sacrafice is obedience to the law.  This is the line of thought which finally led to the identification of holiness with moral perfection.  But when this point is reached, holiness loses its meaning as the 'sperated', the 'transcending', the 'fascinating and terrifying', the 'entirely other'. All this is gone, and the holy has become the morally good and the logically true.  It has ceased to be the holy in the genuine sense of the word.”
- “...one could say that the holy originally lies below the alternative of the good and evil; that it is both divine and demonic...” (Nietzsche would say 'Beyond', and Tillich would have to have known this when writing 'below')
- “The holy which is demonic, or ultimately destructive, is indentical wit hthe content of idolatrous faith.  Idolatrous faith is still faith.  The holy which is demonic is still holy.”
- “...the danger of faith is idolatry...”
- “Our ultimate concern can destroy us as it can heal us.”  (indeed, Heisman)
- “An act of faith is an act of a finite being who is grasped by and turned to the infinite.”
- “Faith is certain in so far as it is an experience of the holy.  But faith is uncertain in so far as the infinite to which it is related is received by the finite being.  This element of uncertainty in faith cannot be removed, it must be accepted.  And the element in faith which accepts this is courage. Faith includes an element of immediate awareness which gives certainty and an element of uncertainty.  To accept this is courage.”
- “Courage as an element of faith is the daring self-affirmation of one's own being in spite of the power of 'nonbeing' which are the heritage of everything finite.”  (acting in the face of death; in spite of how death takes away the meaning, purpose, value of all actions.  'We all end up the same', 'if we all die, if there is no ultimate justice, then all is permitted', etc.)
- “The is a risk if what was considered as a matter of ultimate concern proves to be a matter or preliminary and transitory concern- as, for example, the nation.  The risk to faith in one's ultimate concern is indeed the greatest risk a man can run.  For if it proves to be a failure, the meaning of one's life breaks down; one surrenders oneself, including truth and justice, to something which is not worth it.”  (this is the sick joke that is life, it seems that everyone, no matter what is doing this. Ha! That's a maddening thought.  Everything around me, including myself, is part of something insane, absurd, Nihilistic)
- “The reaction of despair in people who have experienced the breakdown of their national claims is an irrefutable proof of the idolatrous character of their national concern.  In the long run this is the inescapable result of an ultimate concern, the subject matter of which is not ultimate.”
- on how all concrete elements of religion must be symbolic due to the finite/infinite distinction- “A god disappears; divinity remains.”
- “If faith is understood as belief that something is true, doubt is incompatible with the act of faith.  If faith is understood as being ultimately concerned, doubt is a necessary element in it.” (finite/infinite distinction, the concrete symbols will never 'receive' the Other, the Holy 'in full')
- “The skeptical doubt is an attitude towards all beliefs of man, from sense experiences to religious creeds.  It is more an attitude than an assertion.  For as an assertion it would conflict with itself.  Even the assertion that there is no possible  truth for man would be judged by the skeptical principle and could not stand as an assertion.” (self-refuting nature, which means that the 'negative' to be coherent, must accept that they are taking something seriously, and therefore embrace that there is something behind this 'despair over meaninglessness, loss of truth, etc.' CTB pg. 176- 'The act of accepting meaninglessness is a meaningful act. It is an act of faith', a criticism that seemingly refutes Camus)
- on the self-refuting nature of 'skepticism'- “Genuine skeptical doubt does not use the form of an assertion.  It is an attitude of actually rejecting any certainty.  There, it cannot be refuted logically.  It does not transform its attitude into a proposition.  Such an attitude necessarily leads to either despair or cynicism, or to both alternately.  And often, if this alternative becomes intolerable, it leads to indifference and the attempt to develop an attitude of complete unconcern...such an escape finally breaks down.  This is the dynamics of skeptical doubt.  It has an awakening and liberating function...”
- “The despair about truth by the skeptic shows that truth is still his infinite passion.”  (Courage to be pg. 176, this is why suffering teaches you something, i.e. how could these sorts of experiences be generated from a mindless process with no ultimate purpose and only pragmatically?)
- “The cynical superiority over every concrete truth shows that truth is still taken seriously and that the impact of the question of an ultimate concern is strongly felt.” (Again, CTB, pg. 176, exactly: how is one from of concrete worship 'less' than another?  How do we criticize if we no longer have an ultimate concern for truth?  Self-refuting)
- faith and doubt- “...the doubt of him who is ultimately concerned about a concrete content.  One could call it existential doubt, in contrast to the methodological and the skeptical doubt.  It does not question whether a special proposition is true or false.  It does not reject every concrete truth, but it is aware of the element of insecurity in every existential truth.”
- “The description of anxiety as the awareness of one's finitude is sometimes criticized as untrue from the point of view of the ordinary state of mind.  Anxiety, one says, appears under special conditions but is not an ever-present implication of man's finitude.”
- “But the underlying structure of finite life is the universal condition which makes the appearance of anxiety under special conditions possible.  In the same what doubt is not a permanent experience with the act of faith.  But it is always present as an element in the structure of faith.”
- “Many Christians, as well as other religious groups, feel anxiety, guilt and despair about what they call 'loss of faith.'  But serious doubt is confirmation of faith.  It indicates the seriousness of the concern, its unconditional character.” (again, CTB pg. 176, the seriousness in which one still takes a 'negation' turns it into a 'positive', unless sit wants to be self-refuting)
- “How can a faith which has doubt as an element within itself be united with creedal statements of the community of faith?  The answer can only be that creedal expressions of the ultimate concern of the community must include their own criticism.  It must become obvious to them- be they liturgical, doctrinal or ethical expressions of the faith of the community- that they are not ultimate.  Rather, their function is to point to the ultimate which is beyond all of them.  This is what I call the 'Protestant principle.'”  (Vivekananda has the same view, since he also experiences the Divine in a 'entirely other' sort of view, rather than finite, transitory, worldly.  The finite/infinite gap is unbridgeable.  Hence, symbolism, i.e. everyone is an idolater)
- on chapter two of what 'faith is not'- Tillich wants to make sure that 'faith' is not a 'low degree of knowledge', it is when all finite things do not satisfy, when there is a pull towards the infinite, where we directly experience a sense of the infinite that we feel we may be able to be part of.  We create symbols to reinact, interact, etc. with this experience, but they are only symbols; the finite/infinite distinction is unbridgeable.  Therefore, the ultimate concern is not with the scientific, it is not with anything finite, it is not in 'conflict' with any empirical or transitory issues.  Even when rallying against the 'ultimate concern', e.g. atheists, they are affirming a sense of 'rightness' and 'truth' that is showing some form of concern or ultimacy, and needs to recognize the symbolism of faith, and know that we are all striving towards the same infinite.  Tillich speaks of being grasped, I would say by the feeling of Nihilism, i.e. the absurd perspective, and therefore in the face of death/meaninglessness, in order to even despair over the human situation, must take that meaninglessness as ultimate, hence the absurd perspective. The Human is forced to make moral judgments, it cannot escape it, but this is absolutely insane in a Nihilistic world, so there must be a 'truth' out there, and infinite something.)
- on chapter three about 'symbolism'-
- “Religiously speaking, God transcends his own name.  This is why the use of his name easily becomes an abuse or blasphemy.  Whatever we say about that which concerns us ultimately, whether or not we call it God, has a symbolic meaning.”
- “In any case, he who denies God as a matter of ultimate concern affirms God, because he affirms ultimacy in his concern. God is the fundamental symbol for what concern us ultimately.” (CTB pg. 176)
- “Here again it would be meaningless to ask whether one or another of the figures in which an ultimate concern is symbolized does 'exist.'  If 'existence' refers to something which can be foiund withing the whole of reality, no divine being exists.  The question is not this, but: which of the numerable symbols of faith is most adequate to the meaning of faith?  In other words, which symbol of faith ultimately expresses the ultimate without idolatrous elements?”
- “All the qualities we attribute to him, power, love, justice, are taken from finite experiences and applied symbolically to that which is beyond finitude and infinity.”
- “Holy things are not holy in themselves, but they point, beyond themselves to the source of all holiness, that which is of ultimate concern.”
- “Those who live in an unbroken mythological world feel safe and certain. They resist, often fanatically, any attempt to introduce an element of uncertainty by 'breaking the myth,' namely, by making conscious its symbolic character.”
- “The resistance against demythologization expresses itself in literalism...The character of the symbol to point beyond itself to something else is disregarded...The fall of Adam is localized on a special geographical point and attributed to a human individual. The virgin birth of the Messiah is understood in biological terms, ressurection and ascension as physical events...The presupposition of such literalism is that God is a being, acting in time and space, dwelling in a special place...”
“Literalism deprives God of his ultimacy and, religiously speaking, of his majesty.  It draws him down to the level of that which is not ultimate, the finite and conditional.”
- “Faith, if it takes its symbolism literally, becomes idolatrous!  It calls something ultimate that is less than ultimate.  Faith, conscious of the symbolic character of its symbols, gives God the honor which is due to him.”
- “It grasps the mind with terrifying and fascinating power.  It breaks into the ordinary reality, shakes it and drives it beyond itself in an ecstatic way.”  (entheogens)
- “Man's faith is inadequate if his whole existence is determined by something that is less than ultimate.”
- “...to face ones's own relativity one the greatness and danger...”  (courage in the face of knowing that you cannot bridge the finite/infinite gap and are therefore left with Nihilism, relativism, uncertainty, doubt, being 'wrong')
- faith- “...the infinite tension between the absoluteness of its claim and the relativity of its life.” (Divided-self, double-mindedness, doubt, the courage that is needed to handle this sort of uncertainty/relativity)
- “This jar of water, this piece of bread, this cup of wine, this tree, this movement of the hands, of the knees, this building, this river, this color, this word, this book, this person is a bearer of the holy.  In them faith experiences the content of its ultimate concern.”
- sacraments- “They produce awe, fascination, adoration, idolatrous distortion, criticism, replacement by other bearers of the holy.”
- “It is the state of being grasped by the holy through a special medium.” (entheogens, Bach)
- “As a theoretical judgement claiming general validity, it is a meaningless combination of words. But in the correlation between the subject and the author of faith, it has meaning and truth.  The outside observer can only state that there is a correlation of faith between the one who has faith and the sacramental object of his faith.  But he cannot deny or affirm the validity of this correlation of faith.”  (Vivekananda, finite/infinite gap, James and the 'only self-justifying' nature of religious experience)
- “There is no criterion by which faith can be judged from outside the correlation of faith.”
- HOWEVER- “The faithful can ask himself or be asked by someone else whether the medium through which he experiences ultimate concern expresses real ultimacy.”
- “...the inadequacy of the finite...The human mind, however, forgets this inadequacy and identifies the sacred object with the ultimate itself.  The sacramental object is taken as holy in itself.  Its character as the bearer of the holy, pointing beyond itself, disappears in the act of faith.  The act of faith is no longer directed toward the ultimate self, but toward that which represents the ultimate- the tree, the book, the building, the person.”  (symbolism, Vivekananda)
- Mystics- “They indentified the ultimate with the ground or substance of everything- the one, the ineffable, the being above being.”  The interest in mystical faith is not to reject concrete, sacramental ways of faith, but to go beyond them.”
- “Mysticism is not irrational.”
- “But they realized that the true content of faith in an ultimate concern can neither be identified with a piece of reality, as sacramental faith desires, nor be expressed in terms of a rational system. It is a matter of ecstatic experience, and one can only speak of the ultimate in a language which at the same times denies the possibility of speaking about it.” (negative theology, finite/infinite gap)
- “How is such an experience possible if the ultimate is that which transcends all possible experience?” (Indeed!  Great question!  Entheogens, suffering, etc.)
- “In order to go into it, man must empty himself of all the finite contents of his ordinary life; he must surrender all preliminary concerns for the sake of the ultimate concern.  He must transcend the division of existence...The ultimate is beyond this division, and he who wants to reach the ultimate must overcome this division in himself by meditation, contemplation and ecstasy.” (Vivekananda, renunciation! Entheogens, psylocibin, cannabis)
- “The mystic is aware of the infinite distance between the infinite and the finite, and accepts a life of preliminary stages of union with the infinite, interrupted only rarely, and perhaps never, in this life by the final ecstasy.”
- “History has shown this weakness and final emptiness of all merely secular cultures.”
- “The question of faith is not Moses or Jesus or Mohammed; the question is: Who expresses most adequately one's ultimate concern?  The conflict between religions is not a conflict between forms of belief, but it is a conflict between expressions of our ultimate concern.” (Vivekananda)
- “The ultimate shall always be present and remembered even in the smallest activities of the ordinary life.”
- “It is this humanist faith of the moral type (moral demands, rather than rituals or ascetic practices, as with the mystical type of faith) which was taken over by the revolutionary movement of the proletarian masses in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Its dynamic is visible everyday in our present period.  As for every faith, the utopian form of the humanist faith is a state of ultimate concern. This gives tremendous power to good and evil. (the opposite of any mystical type of faith, e.g. Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, Vivekananda, Cioran, any Nihilist, mystic, other/worldly distinction, finite/infinite gap)
- “Faith, in the New Testament, is the state of being grasped by the divine Spirit.”  (being grasped, as Kierkegaard felt, others did as well, that this was something that was 'objectively' getting thrown onto them, it felt out of their control.  The experience of Nihilism is something that is ultimately terrifying and overwhelming, i.e. grasps you)
- “A faith which destroys reason destroys itself and the humanity of man.  For only a being who has the structure of reason is able to be ultimately concerned, to distinguish ultimate and preliminary concerns, to understand the unconditional commands of the ethical imperative, and to be aware of the presence of the holy.” (faith and reason are not in conflict, science and religion are not in conflict.  If they are, it's only superficially and due to naive misunderstandings or conceptions of existence/the human condition/the Divine)
- “Man's reason is finite; it moves within finite relations when dealing with the universe and with man himself.  All cultural activities in which he shapes his world have this character of finitude.  Therefore, they are not matters of ultimate concern.”
- “Man experiences a belonging to the infinite, which, however, is neither a part of himself nor something in his power. It must grasp him, and if it does, it is a matter of infinite concern.  Man is finite, man's reason lives in preliminary concerns; but man is also aware of his potential infinity, and this awareness appears as his ultimate concern.”
- “Reason can be fulfilled only if it is driven beyond the limits of its finitude, and experiences the presence of the ultimate, the holy.  Without such an experience, reason exhausts itself and its finite content.  Finally, it becomes filled with irrational or demonic contents and is destroyed by them.” (is this me?  I agree with this, with Mckenna, that it is about experience.  I need to do mushrooms again.  Another experiment is in order, Heisman is a testament to this)
- “First, it must be acknowledged that man is in a state of estrangement from his true nature.”
- “The criterion of the truth of faith, therefore, is that it implies an element of self-negation.  That symbol is most adequate which expresses not only the ultimate but also it own lack of ultimacy.”
- “The criterion contains a Yes- it does not reject any truth of faith in whatever form it may appear in the history of faith- and it contains a No- it does not accept any truth of faith as ultimate except the one that no man posses it.”  (Vivekananda- more sects of religion, the better, they all point beyond themselves, if they are not idolatrous, Karma Yoga, believe nothing/disbelieve everything.  I could use cannabis, while others may not, I cannot criticize others for their 'brand' of faith, as long as they are only using these symbols as a 'latter' to God, to the Ultimate)
- on being 'grasped'- “Without some participation in the object of one's ultimate concern, it is not possible to be concerned about it.  In this sense ebvery act of faith presupposes participation in that toward which it is directed.  Without a preceding experience of the ultimate no faith in the ultimate can exist.  The mystical type of faith has emphasized this the most strongly."
- "Without hte manifestation of God in man the question of God and faith in God are not possible. There is no faith without participation!" (participation! Turning inward, contemplation, meditation, solitude)
- "He who has faith is seperated from the object of his faith.  Otherwise he would possess it...But the human situation, its finitude and estrangement, prevents man's participation in the ultimate without both the seperation and the promis of faith. Here the limist of mysticism becomes visible;
it neglects the human predicament and the separation of man from the ultimate.  There is no faith without separation.”  (the entire thought of Tillich rests on this finite/infinite distinction that is unbridgeable,	CTB pg. 178- 'the experience of meaninglessness is more radical thatn mysticism.  Therefore it transcends the mystical experience'- whether meaninglessness is 'more radical' or not is one question; what is not disputed is that meaninglessness is more prominent than the mystical experience, doubt shows how important we take our concern)
- “Out of the element of participation follows the certainty of faith; out of the element of separation follows the doubt in faith.”
- “Sometimes doubt conquers faith, but it still contains faith.  Otherwise it would be indifference.”
- “Since the life of faith is life in the state of ultimate concern and no human being can exist completely without such a concern, we can say: Neither faith nor doubt can be eliminated from man as man.”
- “The danger of this method, of course, is that the faith, meditated in education, will remain a traditional attitude and never break through to a state of living faith.  However, if this causes people to become hesitant about communicating any of the given symbols and to wait until independent questions about the meaning of life have arisen, it can lead to a powerful life of faith, but it also can lead to emptiness, to cynicism and, in reaction to it, to idolatrous forms of ultimate concern.”  (Vivekananda, direct experience, psylocibin, cannabis, academic philosophy is a joke)
- “It is experienced in passion, anxiety, despair, ecstasy.”
- “In the mystical literature the 'vision of God is...In the complete reunion with the divine ground of being, the element of distance is overcome and with it uncertainty, doubt, courage and risk. The finite is taken into the infinite; it is not extinguished, but it is not separated either.  This is not the ordinary human condition.  To the state of separated finitude belong faith and the courage to risk.  The risk of faith is the concrete content of one's ultimate concern.” (psylocibin is the mystical experience that does remove doubt, faith, courage, etc.  The Nihilism of everyday experience is more 'prevalent' as Tillich mentions in both Faith and Courage pg. 178)
- “We are never able to bridge the infinite distance between the infinite and the finite from the side of the finite.  This alone makes the courage of faith possible.  The risk of failure, of error and of idolatrous distortion can be taken, because the failure cannot separate us from what is our ultimate concern.”  (sickness unto death, the doubt, the despair does not end, does not cease, it is omnipresent in the finite world)
- “The ultimate concern gives depth, direction and unity to all other concerns and, with them, to the whole personality.”
- “Ultimate concern is passionate concern; it is a matter of infinite passion.”  (Vivekananda speaks of the thief left in the room with gold, the boy who has his head held under water, going 'mad' for God as Plato and Cioran testify to, Vivekananda also mentions that the religious believers around us are ot infinitely passionate about God, as Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, Nietzsche all felt as well)
- “The body can participate both in vital ecstasy and in asceticism leading to spiritual ecstasy.”
- “The objects of modern secular idolatry, such as nation and success, have shown healing power, not only by the magic fascination of a leader, a slogan or a promise but also by the fulfillment of otherwise unfulfilled strivings for a meaningful life.  But the basis for integration is too narrow.”
- Idolatrous faith- “Spiritual creativity shows an increasingly shallow and empty character, because no infinite meaning gives depth to it.  The passion of faith is transformed into the suffering of unconquered doubt and despair, and in many cases into an escape to neurosis and psychosis.” (the poison of naturalism)
- “One is ultimately concerned only about something to which one essentially belongs and from which one is existentially separated.”
- “Mystical love unites by negation of the self.  Ethical love transforms by affirmation of the self. The sphere of activities following from mystical love is predominantly ascetic. The sphere of activities following from ethical love is predominantly formative” (is this the difference between jnana and bhakti/karm yoga?)
- “That which is based on an ultimate concern is not exposed to destruction by preliminary concerns and the lack of their fulfillment.”
- “Without symbols in which the holy is experienced as present, the experience of the holy vanishes.”
- “If the myth is understood literally, philosophy must reject it as absurd.  It must demythologize the sacred stories, transform the myth into a philosophy of religion and finally into a philosophy without religion.”  (Vivekananda- The Necessity of Religion, particularly the last two pages, an 'infinite religion')
- “...no one is completely without an ultimate concern.”  (in order to negate the claim of not having an ultimate concern, you'd have to ironically revolt against ultimate concerns, therefore putting a positive notion onto the lack of having an ultimate concern, i.e. showing ultimate concern, i.e. the self-contradictory nature of nihilism)
- “Faith is a concept- and a reality- which is difficult to grasp and to describe.”

The Courage To Be

- Pg. 175  “The answer must accept, as its precondition, the state of meaninglessness.  It is not an answer if it demands the removal of this state; for that is just what cannot be done.  He who is in the grip of doubt and meaninglessness cannot liberate himself from this grip...if one does not try to escape the question...In this situation the meaning of life is reduced to despair about the meaning of life.” (this is the thesis/conclusion(?) of the entire book)

2.3 Hints of Practical Spirituality

- “We are always making the mistake of judging others; we are always inclined to think that our little mental universe is all that is; our ethics, our morality, our sense of duty, our sense of utility are the only things that are worth having.”
- “I begin to understand the marvelous saying of Christ: 'Judge not that ye not be judged.'  The more we learn, the more we find out how ignorant we are, how multiform and multi-sided is this mind of man.”
- “But I must ask you to bear in mind that, as there is religious superstition, so also there is a superstition in the matter of science. There are priests who take up religious work as their speciality; so also there are priests of physical law, scientists. As soon as a great scientist's name, like Darwin or Huxley, is cited, we follow blindly. It is the fashion of the day...True science asks us to be cautious. Just as we should be careful with the priests, so we should be with the scientists. Begin with disbelief. Analyse, test, prove everything, and then take it.”
- “You will be astonished to hear that they have no churches, no Common Prayers, or anything of the kind; but they, every day, still practice the breathings and try to concentrate the mind; and that is the chief part of their devotion.”  (all Truth should be available to everyone at 'anytime, if one puts in the effort/participation, Sam Harris said this in a recent talk, and it seems true if our consciousness has within itself the Divine, or whatever one wants to define as the 'divine')
- “The second is the fear of persecution. A man, for instance, would not like to practice breathing publicly in this country, because he would be thought so queer; it is not the fashion here. On the other hand, in India. if a man prayed, "Give us this day our daily bread", people would laugh at him. Nothing could be more foolish to the Hindu mind than to say, "Our Father which art in Heaven." The Hindu, when he worships, thinks that God is within himself.”
- “The reality of everything is the same infinite. This is not idealism; it is not that the world does not exist. It has a relative existence, and fulfils all its requirements But it has no independent existence. It exists because of the Absolute Reality beyond time, space, and causation.”
- “Everyone without exception, everyone of us, can attain to this culmination of Yoga. But it is a terrible task. If a person wants to attain to this truth, he will have to do something more than to listen to lectures and take a few breathing exercises. Everything lies in the preparation. How long does it take to strike a light? Only a second; but how long it takes to make the candle! How long does it take to eat a dinner? Perhaps half an hour. But hours to prepare the food! We want to strike the light in a second, but we forget that the making of the candle is the chief thing.” (participation- mine seems to be in the form of contemplation)
- “"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and everything shall be added unto you." This is the one great duty, this is renunciation. Live for an ideal, and leave no place in the mind for anything else. Let us put forth all our energies to acquire that, which never fails — our spiritual perfection. If we have true yearning for realisation, we must struggle, and through struggle growth will come. We shall make mistakes, but they may be angels unawares. The greatest help to spiritual life is meditation (Dhyâna). In meditation we divest ourselves of all material conditions and feel our divine nature. We do not depend upon any external help in meditation.”
- “For it is the body that drags us down. It is attachment, identification, which makes us miserable. That is the secret: To think that I am the spirit and not the body, and that the whole of this universe with all its relations, with all its good and all its evil, is but as a series of paintings — scenes on a canvas — of which I am the witness.” (stop identifying with Naturalism, with the 'mindless' evolutionary tale of all life. The reduction of humans to mechanisms as such.  Let this Heisman view disappear.  Embrace the entheogens. Attempt to stop despairing over the material,  the body, the physical)

2.4 Bhakti or Devotion

- “In various religions this love and devotion is manifested in various degrees, at different stages. The lowest stage is that of ritualism, when abstract ideas are almost impossible, and are dragged down to the lowest plane, and made concrete. Forms come into play, and, along with them, various symbols. Throughout the history of the world, we find that man is trying to grasp the abstract through thought-forms, or symbols. All the external manifestations of religion — bells, music, rituals, books, and images — come under that head. Anything that appeals to the senses, anything that helps man to form a concrete image of the abstract, is taken hold of, and worshipped.”  (Tillich?)
- “From time to time, there have been reformers in every religion who have stood against all symbols and rituals. But vain has been their opposition, for so long as man will remain as he is, the vast majority will always want something concrete to hold on to, something around which, as it were, to place their ideas, something which will be the centre of all the thought-forms in their minds.”
- “It is vain to preach against the use of symbols, and why should we preach against them? There is no reason why man should not use symbols. They have them in order to represent the ideas signified behind them. This universe is a symbol, in and through which we are trying to grasp the thing signified, which is beyond and behind. The spirit is the goal, and not matter. Forms, images, bells, candles, books, churches, temples, and all holy symbols are very good, very helpful to the growing plant of spirituality, but thus far and no farther. In the test majority of cases, we find that the plant does not grow. It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church. It is very good to be born within the limits of certain forms that help the little plant of spirituality, but if a man dies within the bounds of these forms, it shows that he has not grown, that there has been no development of the soul. If, therefore, any one says that symbols, rituals, and forms are to be kept for ever, he is wrong; but if he says, that these symbols and rituals are a help to the growth of the soul, in its low and undeveloped state, he is right. But, you must not mistake this development of the soul as meaning anything intellectual. A man can be of gigantic intellect, yet spiritually he may be a baby. You can verify it this moment. All of you have been taught to believe in an Omnipresent God. Try to think of it. How few of you can have any idea of what omnipresence means! If you struggle hard, you will get something like the idea of the ocean, or of the sky, or of a vast stretch of green earth, or of a desert. All these are material images, and so long as you cannot conceive of the abstract as abstract, of the ideal as the ideal, you will have to resort to these forms, these material images. It does not make much difference whether these images are inside or outside the mind. We are all born idolaters, and idolatry is good, because it is in the nature of man. Who can get beyond it? Only the perfect man, the God-man. The rest are all idolaters. So long as we see this universe before us, with its forms and shapes, we are all idolaters. This is a gigantic symbol we are worshipping. He who says he is the body is a born idolater. We are spirit, spirit that has no form or shape, spirit that is infinite, and not matter. Therefore, anyone who cannot grasp the abstract, who cannot think of himself as he is, except in and through matter, as the body, is an idolater. And yet how people fight among themselves, calling one another idolaters! In other words, each says, his idol is right, and the others' are wrong. Therefore, we should get rid of these childish notions. We should get beyond the prattle of men who think that religion is merely a mass of frothy words, that it is only a system of doctrines; to whom religion is only a little intellectual assent or dissent; to whom religion is believing in certain words which their own priests tell them; to whom religion is something which their forefathers believed; to whom religion is a certain form of ideas and superstitions to which they cling because they are their national superstitions. We should get beyond all these and look at humanity as one vast organism, slowly coming towards light — a wonderful plant, slowly unfolding itself to that wonderful truth which is called God — and the first gyrations, the first motions, towards this are always through matter and through ritual.”
- “In modern times, Christian clergymen have become a little kinder, and they allow that in the older religions, the different forms of worship were foreshadowings of Christianity, which of course, they consider, is the only true form. God tested Himself in older times, tested His powers by getting these things into shape which culminated in Christianity. This, at least, is a great advance. Fifty years ago they would not have said even that; nothing was true except their own religion. This idea is not limited to any religion, nation, or class of persons; people are always thinking that the only right thing to be done by others is what they themselves are doing. And it is here that the study of different religions helps us. It shows us that the same thoughts that we have been calling ours, and ours alone, were present hundreds of years ago in others, and sometimes even in a better form of expression than our own. These are the external forms of devotion, through which man has to pass; but if he is sincere, if he really wants to reach the truth, he goes higher than these, to a plane where forms are as nothing. Temples or churches, books or forms, are simply the kindergarten of religion, to make the spiritual child strong enough to take higher steps...”
- “Who is longing?  That is the question. Religion is not in doctrines, in dogmas, nor in intellectual argumentation; it is being and becoming, it is realisation. We hear so many talking about God and the soul, and all the mysteries of the universe, but if you take them one by one, and ask them, "Have you realised God? Have you seen your Soul?" — how many can say they have? And yet they are all fighting with one another! At one time, in India, representatives of different sects met together and began to dispute. One said that the only God was Shiva; another said, the only God was Vishnu, and so on; and there was no end to their discussion. A sage was passing that way, and was invited by the disputants to decide the matter. He first asked the man who was claiming Shiva as the greatest God, "Have you seen Shiva? Are you acquainted with Him? If not, how do you know He is the greatest God?" Then turning to the worshipper of Vishnu, he asked, "Have you seen Vishnu?" And after asking this question to all of them, he found out that not one of them knew anything of God. That was why they were disputing so much, for had they really known, they would not have argued. When a jar is being filled with water, it makes a noise, but when it is full, there is no noise. So, the very fact of these disputations and fighting among sects shows that they do not know anything about religion. Religion to them is a mere mass of frothy words, to be written in books. Each one hurries to write a big book, to make it as massive as possible, stealing his materials from every book he can lay his hands upon, and never acknowledging his indebtedness. Then he launches this book upon the world, adding to the disturbance that is already existing there.” (symbolism, direct experience, ultimate concern, not an intellectual, at least not purely or not irrational, nonrational is a better term, not about security which breads fundamentalism, but a search for Truth which breads questioning everything, believe nothing and disbelieve everything)
- “The vast majority of men are atheists. I am glad that, in modern times, another class of atheists has come into existence in the Western world — I mean the materialists. They are sincere atheists.  They are better than the religious atheists, who are insincere, who fight and talk about religion, and yet do not want it, never try to realise it, never try to understand it.”   (the materialists may be sincere in their logical conclusions of Naturalism, but that does not me that they realize the Nihilism that stems from materialism anymore than the 'religious atheist', as Vivekananda defines him, that does not realize the truths of religion)
- “Who wants God?  That is the question.  Do you think that all this mass of people in the world want God, and cannot have him?  That cannot be.”
- “This desire for perfection, for reaching the goal and getting beyond nature, how can it be there, until something has created it and drilled it into the soul of man, and makes it live there? He, therefore, in whom this desire is awakened, will reach the goal. We want everything but God. This is not religion that you see all around you. My lady has furniture in her parlour, from all over the world, and now it is the fashion to have something Japanese; so she buys a vase and puts it in her room. Such is religion with the vast majority; they have all sorts of things for enjoyment, and unless they add a little flavour of religion, life is not all right, because society would criticise them.”
- “A disciple went to his master and said to him, "Sir, I want religion." The master looked at the young man, and did not speak, but only smiled. The young man came every day, and insisted that he wanted religion. But the old man knew better than the young man. One day, when it was very hot, he asked the young man to go to the river with him and take a plunge. The young man plunged in, and the old man followed him and held the young man down under the water by force. After the young man had struggled for a while, he let him go and asked him what he wanted most while he was under the water. "A breath of air", the disciple answered. "Do you want God in that way? If you do, you will get Him in a moment," said the master. Until you have that thirst, that desire, you cannot get religion, however you may struggle with your intellect, or your books, or your forms. Until that thirst is awakened in you, you are no better than any atheist; only the atheist is sincere, and you are not. A great sage used to say, "Suppose there is a thief in a room, and somehow he comes to know that there is a vast mass of gold in the next room, and that there is only a thin partition between the two rooms What would be the condition of that thief? He would be sleepless, he would not be able to eat or do anything. His whole mind would be on getting that gold. Do you mean to say that, if all these people really believed that the Mine of Happiness, of Blessedness, of Glory were here, they would act as they do in the world, without trying to get God?" As soon as a man begins to believe there is a God, he becomes mad with longing to get to Him. Others may go their way, but as soon as a man is sure that there is a much higher life than that which he is leading here, as soon as he feels sure that the senses are not all, that this limited, material body is as nothing compared with the immortal, eternal, undying bliss of the Self, he becomes mad until he finds out this bliss for himself. And this madness, this thirst, this mania, is what is called the "awakening" to religion, and when that has come, a man is beginning to be religious. But it takes a long time. All these forms and ceremonies, these prayers and pilgrimages, these books, bells, candles, and priests, are the preparations; they take off the impurities from the soul. And when the soul has become pure, it naturally wants to get to the mine of all purity, God Himself.”
- “Yet all these forms and symbols are simply the beginning, bot the true love of God.” (Tillich says the same thing, the god above God)
- “The first test of love is that it knows no bargaining. So long as you see a man love another only to get something from him, you know that that is not love; it is shopkeeping. Wherever there is any question of buying and selling, it is not love.” (selflessness, Kierkegaard mentions the egotistical motivations of faith)
- “'Lord give me more wealth, more children, more territory…' This is not the language of love.”
- “Where do you ever see love in fear? It is always a sham. With love never comes the idea of fear. Think of a young mother in the street: if a dog barks at her, she flees into the nearest house. The next day she is in the street with her child, and suppose a lion rushes upon the child, where will be her position? Just at the mouth of the lion, protecting her child. Love conquered all her fear. So also in the love of God. Who cares whether God is a rewarder or a punisher? That is not the thought of a lover. Think of a judge when he comes home, what does his wife see in him? Not a judge, or a rewarder or punisher, but her husband, her love. What do his children see in him? Their loving father, not the punisher or rewarder. So the children of God never see in Him a punisher or a rewarder. It is only people who have never tasted of love that fear and quake. Cast off all fear — though these horrible ideas of God as a punisher or rewarder may have their use in savage minds. Some men, even the most intellectual, are spiritual savages, and these ideas may help them. But to men who are spiritual, men who are approaching religion, in whom spiritual insight is awakened, such ideas are simply childish, simply foolish. Such men reject all ideas of fear.”
- “The perfect man sees nothing but God. So we always worship our highest ideal, and when we have reached the point, when we love the ideal as the ideal, all arguments and doubts vanish for ever. Who cares whether God can be demonstrated or not? The ideal can never go, because it is a part of my own nature. I shall only question the ideal when I question my own existence, and as I cannot question the one, I cannot question the other. Who cares whether God can be almighty and all-merciful at the same time or not ? Who cares whether He is the rewarder of mankind, whether He looks at us with the eyes of a tyrant or with the eyes of a beneficent monarch? The lover has passed beyond all these things, beyond rewards and punishments, beyond fears and doubts, beyond scientific or any other demonstration.”  (great description of the 'Knight of Faith')
- “Thus we come to what is called supreme Bhakti, supreme devotion, in which forms and symbols fall off. One who has reached that cannot belong to any sect, for all sects are in him. To what shall he belong? For all churches and temples are in him. Where is the church big enough for him? Such a man cannot bind himself down to certain limited forms.”
- “The true lovers of God want to become mad, inebriated with the love of God, to become 'God-intoxicated men.'”

4.2.17 The Practice of Religion
●	
52. Martin Heidegger

(21-22) seems like an important part about being in itself and the 'structures' that the world, in the form of culture, throws itself onto a form, or disguise of being, which allows for the discovery of Existence to never take place, since the role of explaining existence has been taken up in the role within a particular cultures/set of values, etc.

(251-254) is talk about the ignoring of death, similar to Vivekananda's Maya where people just 'put off' their own deaths, e.g. it happens to 'them', 'her' or 'him', but not to me.  People live in this deluded state to ward off the anxiety of death, of nonbeing.

“...being towards death has turned out to be an evasion in the face of death- an evasion which conceals.”  Hiedegger-

**52.** Everyday being towards the end…

(261-262) the distinction between brooding over how or when we will die, and that we will die.  One seems obsessive and neurotic, while the other seems philosophical.  And this is exactly what he seems to say in 262-263, where he labels the awareness of death as an 'anticipation' rather than an 'actualizing' of death.”
“In the anticipation of this possibility it becomes 'greater and greater;' that is to say, the possibility reveals itself to be such that it knows no measure at all, no more or less, but signifies the possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence.”  (Me: Ha!  Pretty good) 263-263- our death is what separates us from others, it puts everything into our perspective, it ought to take away the influence of the 'others' who throw their nonsense onto you.  Death ought to eliminate this pressure from others.  The anticipation of my own death out to break me free to live in what Heidegger would could an authentic way.

“What anxiety is about is being in the world itself.”  (Me: universal in nature, Kierkegaard for sure)

“The moment of vision, however, brings existence into the Situation and discloses the authentic 'there'."

(Me: This seems to be in the context of finitude, man's 'normal' situation of ignoring/repressing his finitude, but the 'moment of vision' the anxiety in the face of Nothingness, of nonbeing, brings forth the 'now' instead of constantly thinking about the past or future.  The future is the 'falling' into death, the transitory/fleeting nature of Being)

“Curiosity is 'activated' not by the endless immensity of what we have not yet seen, but rather by the falling kind of temporalizing which belongs to the present as it leaps away.  Even if one has seen everything, this is precisely when the 'curiosity' fabricates something new.”  (Me: Transcendental yearning. It's not the distractions of the finite that leads us on, it's the desire for the Infinite.  The transitory, 'leaping away', of the finite cannot satisfy our craving for the Infinite)

“Having been thrown into Being-towards-death, Dasein flees- proximally and for the most part- in the face of this throwness, which has been more or less explicitly revealed.”

“Dasein gets dragged along into throwness: that is to say, as something that has been thrown into the world, it loses itself in the world in its factical submission to that with which it is to concern itself.” 68 C(the need for renunciation, contemplation, meditation, inwardness, a separation from the worldly)

“To designate the authentic terminologically we have reserved the expression 'anticipation'.  This indicates that Dasein, existing authentically, lets itself come towards itself as its ownmost potentiality-for-being- that the future itself must win itself, not from a Present, but from the inauthentic future.” (Me- anticipating death allows us to see our existence for what it is, passing, falling, transitory.  In order to exist authentically, we must reject the world, its cultures, its morals, its ideas, the arbitrary, unthinking influence of outsiders/others. We must be our own individuals of renunciation)

“In this, Dasein is taken back all the way to its naked uncanniness, and becomes fascinated by it. This fascination, however, not only takes Dasein back from its 'worldly' possibilities, but at the same time gives it the possibility of an authentic potentiality-for-being.” (Me- this is so legit.  This is the experience of Solitude, the idea of losing all subjectivity within subjectivity, which seems to allow for the 'objective' viewpoint, i.e. the renunciation of the worldly realm and the introduction, the experience of the Nothingness, the Nihilism, the Other, the Infinite)

“In particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite with which one can concern onself; the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these 'says' anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have any involvement.  _The world in which I exist has sunk into insignificance_ (my emphasis); and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement.  _Anxiety is anxious in the face of the nothing of the world_ (my italics); but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what is present-at-hand with-the-world. The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does not have any involvement whatsoever, but can show itself in an empty mercilessness.  This implies, however, that our concernful awaiting finds nothing in terms of which it might be able to understand itself; it clutches at the 'nothing' of the world; but when our understanding has come up against the world, it is brought to Being-in-the-world as such through anxiety.  Being-in-the-world, however, is both what anxiety is anxious in-the-face-of which one has anxiety is indeed already 'there'- namely, Dasein  itself.” (Tillich CTB pg.39- the great digsust, a human cannot stand in stark naked anxiety for too long without going mad, one must renounce to the point of mercilessness anxiety overwhelming you in order to discover your authentic self, the world itself is not the concern, the worldly affairs drop away, and there is only concern with what Tillich would refer to as the 'ultimate concern', or for Heidegger the Authentic-se that is not repressed by thr worldly, material self, as with Kierkegaard, Tillich, Cioran, this anxiety is Universal to all humans, the human condition, it is part of Dasein or Being)

“Anxiety discloses an insignificance of the world; and this insignificance reveals the nullity of that with which one can concern oneself- or, in other words, the impossibility of projecting oneself upon a potentiality-for-Being be lit up.  What is the temporal meaning of this revealing?  Anxiety is anxious about naked Dasein as something that has been thrown into uncanniness.”

“Anxiety liberates him from possibilities which 'count for nothing', and lets him become free for those which are authentic.” (The authentic is to live as a Self, to discover what the Self is. It is not distractions of earthly, finite, transitory life. Authenticity is the realization of the Self as something 'more' than material)

read pg. 394/side note 344 concerning the universality and inescapability of anxiety and how it is the 'mood' or a foundation for a 'moment of vision' which allows for a 'resolution'.  The resolution is God, the anxiety is Nihilism, Nihilism is God.  The 'worldly' possibilities cannot distract one anymore, in anxiety the world crumbles, everything is emptied, Nihilism shows the Nothingness of the world)

To say 'I know nothing about nothing' is to say, in the opposite, the same self-refuting nature of if Nihilism is true, then Nihilism cannot be true.  Socrates' proposition was simply Nihilism in reverse. I know that I know nothing.

Hope- is not said to be a hope for a 'future event', but rather it has the deeper significance of discovering your true Self.  Heidegger is religious as fuck.  “indifference' is not the same as embracing death and existence. end of pg. 395-396-

'As the Present leaps away…' even if one has experienced everything, curiosity fabricates something new. There is a transcendental yearning when faced with the Nothingness of the world.  There is a constant moving forward.  Is this a tale of survival?  Or is there a deeper, 'religious' meaning behind this psychological human fact?

pg. 399, side-note 348- Curiosity.

“When Dasein is resolute, it takes over authentically in its existence the fact that it is the null basis of its own nullity.  We have conceived death existentially as what we have characterized as the possibility of the impossibility  of existence- that is to say, as the utter nullity of Dasein.  Death is not 'added on' to Dasein at its 'end' but Dasein, as care, is the thrown (that is, null) basis for death.  The nullity by which Dasein's Being is dominated primordially through and through, is revealed to Dasein itself in authentic Being-towards-death. Only on the basis of Dasein's whole Being does anticipation make Being-guilty manifest. Care harbours itself in both death and guilt equiprimordially.  Only anticipatory resoluteness understands the potentiality-for-Being-guilty authentically and wholly- that is to say, primordially. When the call of conscience is understood, lostness in the 'they' is revealed.  Resoluteness brings Dasein back to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-self.  When one has an understanding Being-towards-death- towards death as one's ownmost possibility- one's potentiality-for-Being becomes authentic and wholly transparent. The call of conscience passes over in its appeal all Dasein's 'worldly' prestige and potentialities.”  (yes, of course the world becomes 'null', all possibilities become 'null', the question at the end of section 53 asks the question of how an existence in that is 'authentic', i.e. that lives fully in the face of the anxiety of the nothingness of the world, is possible)

pg. 354, side-note 304, 177 of 294-

“...authentic resoluteness which resolves to keep repeating itself.” (it does not 'forget' or attempt to 'cover up' the anxiety of existence, i.e. it does not fall into the nothingness of the world and it's null possibilities)

Heidegger says that his sense of 'resoluteness' as the anticipation of Being-towards-death is 'unintelligible' to the common sense manner in which 'they' understand Dasein, or Being, to be.  The path is narrow, Ha!

pg. 357, side-note 310, 178 of 294-

pg. 396, 198 of 294, side-note 346- Heidegger makes a distinction between the worldly hope that allows one to distract oneself with worldly pleasure/issues, i.e. a sort of band-aid, worldly 'help' and an 'ecstatico-temporal relation to the thrown ground of itself', i.e. this sounds like a mystical, entheogenic experience.

162 0f 294, 56. and, especially, 57. need to be re-read.  Heidegger keeps speaking of the 'nothing of the world'.  He also speaks of conscience as a negative that the 'nothing...signifies something positive.” This is a great description of the Nihilistic Experience that sees the nothing of the world as a positive. Heidegger also dismisses the 'biological' dismissal of conscience being merely 'worldy' or not a Beyond that calls us, which in fact is actually still us.  The 'caller' that breaks us away from the 'they' is indefinite, unknown, etc., and this call is brought on, or 'heard', from uncanniness.  Ligotti mentions the uncanniness of the world, something is 'not right here', we are' not at home'.

People that have spoken of Heidegger and about Heidegger by putting his biography forth, or the particular 'clashes' or how he distances himself from a Descartes, or some other philosopher, but these commentators never speak as much, if at all, of his dismissal of both the 'biological' and 'religious' explanations of this experience of the Nothing.  Heidegger refers to this sort of experience, instead, as 'existential'.  Maybe that's a good word.

Read about 'Being with Others”- I think that's the title of the section.  Maybe he speaks in some sort of 'value' terms.  Although, in 58., Heidegger states that the concept of 'Guilty!' must 'drop' the attatchment to 'law-breaking' or an 'ought' or 'concerful being with others', i.e. guilt needs to be ridded of the 'false' morality, i.e. it seems that Heidegger understands the Nothing of this world shows the nullity of all human/worldly morality.

1. Ambiguity- “Idle talk and curiosity take care in their ambiguity to ensure that what is genuinely and newly created is out of date as soon as it emerges before the public.”  (Ha!)
2. Ambiguity- “Dasein is always 'there'- that is to say, in that public disclosedness of Being-with-one-another where the loudest idle talk and the most ingenious curiosity keep 'things moving', where, in an everyday manner, everything (and at bottom nothing) is happening.”  (Ha!)
3. ***Ambiguity***- paraphrase- the people keep things 'exciting' with illusions of existing in an inauthentic way, i.e. the others simply distract themselves with this or that thing that is all the rage, yet falls out of fashion almost as quickly as it appeared.  Everyday interaction seems to be a 'tug-of-war' in figuring out the others illusions, to make sure they do not fully contradict or are too corrosive to our 'everyday' veils that we label as 'living'.  “Under the mask of 'for-one-another', an 'against-one-another' is at play”
4. ***Ambiguity***- paraphrase- The phenomenon of the 'false', 'worthless' mouth-noises of human interaction, i.e. two people attempting to communicate is like having two conflicting monologues going on at the same time.  Heidegger states that this is not a 'conscious' act of the 'they', i.e. this is not a conscious act of confusion or 'disguise'.  'They' don't even realize the nullity of the possibilities of existence.  That is to say, since everyone is 'thrown' into existence and all possibilities are nothing, all starting points for values or ways of being are ultimately false, and this is what 'ambiguity' seems to be. Moreover, it seems to be part of Dasein, something that needs to be 'worked through', i.e. Mckenna says that 'culture is an 'intelligent test', and if you mesh into a culture, then you have failed.  ''They' won't agree to this interpretation since they do not experience their beliefs, their way of life, as an illusion; their lives still have significance.  They, seemingly, only -semi-consciously 'flee' from the illusions that comfort them from their own deaths.  This sentiment is found in 50. and claimed as a 'proof' that since this is not 'generally understood' by the masses, it shows that Dasein contains a sense of 'fleeing' from death.  “It would be a misunderstanding if we were to seek to have the explication of these phenomena confirmed by looking to the 'they' for agreement.”
5. has not only an amazing description of the Nihilistic experience, but also a great explanation for why the atheists and theists of today 'misinterpret' this experience; mainly due to no one wanting to be Authentic, i.e. not wanting any co
