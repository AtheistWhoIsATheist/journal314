- The author reflects on the human tendency to live despite the possibility of death, and questions why people like themselves and philosophers such as Schopenhauer, who understand the emptiness and evil of life, continue to live, suggesting that perhaps they alone are wise enough to see the truth.
- The author comes to realize that their previous way of life, focused on satisfying earthly desires, had hidden the truth from them, and that to truly live, one must renounce worldly pleasures, be humble, and endure, as guided by a higher power or faith.
- The author acknowledges that reason alone did not bring them to their current understanding, but rather an instinctive consciousness of life, which they describe as an embracing of the terrifying mystery of [[Existence | existence]], and notes that faith is not about believing without evidence, but about embracing this mystery.
- The author observes that people around them, including those of similar social standing, either do not understand the question of the meaning of life, or understand it but are too weak to act on it, and that science provides no satisfactory answers to this question, often simply stating "identity" as a response.
- The author references the idea that even wise people, like fools, will eventually die, and that if a person lives, they must believe in something, whether it be the finite or the infinite, and that without faith, there is no life.
- The author also references the thoughts of [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], who would rather die than give up his metaphysical beliefs, and notes that they themselves had to re-examine their past beliefs and explanations for the meaning of life, finding them to be worthless in the light of reason.
- The author concludes that their own position, as well as that of Schopenhauer and others, is foolish, as they understand life to be evil, but continue to live, highlighting the contradictions and paradoxes of human existence, and marking a turning point in their own journey, as they begin to leave behind renunciation and despair.

## Nihilism and the Teachings of Jesus
- The section from the document 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal' discusses the concept of [[Nihilism | nihilism]] and its potential conclusion, as well as the importance of following the teachings of [[Jesus]], particularly the commandment "Resist not evil", which is seen as the central point of his doctrine.
- The text includes quotes from various sources, including Leo Tolstoy's "A Letter to a Hindu" and "My Religion", which highlight the importance of renouncing violence and following the divine law, even if it means suffering and persecution.
- Tolstoy's writings express his struggle to understand and follow Jesus' teachings, including the idea of turning the other cheek and loving one's enemies, and how this requires a complete renunciation of worldly advantages and a willingness to bear all consequences.
- The text also references Friedrich Nietzsche's "AntiChrist", which emphasizes the importance of the commandment "Resist not evil" as a rule whose practice is obligatory, and how it is the key to understanding Jesus' doctrine.
- The author of the document notes the similarities between Tolstoy and Nietzsche's ideas, despite their differing perspectives, and how they both highlight the importance of following Jesus' teachings in a genuine and radical way, rather than just paying lip service to them through rituals and ceremonies.
- The section concludes by emphasizing the need to choose between following the divine law, as taught by Jesus, and the human law, which often prioritizes self-interest and violence, and how this choice has significant implications for one's life and actions.

## The Divine Law vs. Human Law
- The doctrine of [[Jesus]] is directed at denouncing all human errors, including those related to the Church, State, Culture, Science, Art, and Civilization, which are considered empty idols that lead to man's perdition, as emphasized by Jesus, the Hebrew prophets, [[John the Apostle | John]] the Baptist, and other true sages of the world.
- The concept of "Resist not evil" is questioned, and it is argued that the lives of those who do not show love and compassion for their fellow humans, and instead prepare punishments and calamities for them, are indeed vain, highlighting the importance of living a life filled with love and compassion.
- Jesus is seen as one who continued and amplified the absolute divine law, rather than just a prophet revealing a new law, and his teachings are considered to be a continuation of the principles of God, the [[God | creator]] of the world and of man, as understood by the author.
- The author reflects on the results of teaching children to value simplicity and humility, rather than encouraging them to indulge in sensuous desires and materialistic pursuits, and suggests that this approach could lead to a more meaningful and fulfilling life.
- The author notes that both believers and sceptics have a false conception of life, with the sceptics believing in the idea of a life of happiness as a fundamental right, and that this misconception rests on the same foundation as the beliefs of the theologians, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of life and its purpose.
- The concept of "saving" one's life, according to the doctrine of Jesus, is linked to the idea of understanding the personal life of man, as discussed by prophets, [[Solomon]], [[The Buddha | Buddha]], and other wise men, and the author suggests that people often avoid thinking about this theme due to the fear of confronting the abyss of death, as noted by [[Blaise Pascal | Pascal]].
- The author uses the example of people who perished in tragic events, such as the circus at Berditchef or on the slopes of Koukouyef, to illustrate the idea that death is inevitable and can happen to anyone, and that it is essential to find what is imperishable in life and to repent and arouse oneself to avoid a similar fate, as emphasized by [[Jesus]] and other spiritual leaders.

## The Inevitability of Death and the Pursuit of the Imperishable
- The text discusses the inevitability of death and the futility of attempting to escape or guard against it, as death is always present and can occur at any moment, whether through sudden events or gradual decline, and it is pointless to try to avoid it by all imaginable means.
- The quotes highlight the idea that laboring to achieve worldly prosperity is a futile endeavor, as death will always intervene before one can complete their goals, and that the pursuit of personal desires and the accumulation of wealth is ultimately meaningless in the face of mortality.
- The text also explores the difference between the Jewish conception of life, which views mortal life as the true and supreme good, and the [[Christianity | Christian]] perspective, which sees mortal life as a fallen life that is not the true life, and how Jesus founded his doctrine of eternal life on the Hebraic conception of life, emphasizing the importance of renouncing personal desires and merging with the universal life of humanity.
- The doctrine of [[Jesus]] is contrasted with the idea of individual immortality of the soul, which is seen as affirming the continuance of individuality forever, rather than encouraging renunciation of the personal life, and the text suggests that the pursuit of eternal felicity or punishment in the afterlife is not a central tenet of Jesus' teachings, but rather a distraction from the true message of renunciation and service to humanity.
- The text references various philosophers and spiritual leaders, including [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], Tillich, and Eckhart, and notes that the idea of living for something beyond personal desires is a universal theme, with people seeking meaning and purpose in life by living for their children, families, nations, or humanity, and that this desire for transcendence is a fundamental aspect of human nature.
- The author argues that the only path to salvation is through the renunciation of personal will and the alignment with the will of [[God]], and that this is the true meaning of life and death, as revealed by Jesus and echoed in other spiritual traditions, such as the Upanishads, which emphasize the importance of selflessness and service to others.

## Living a Meaningful Life and Death Through the Doctrine of Jesus
- The author reflects on their life, considering it a "stupendous farce" that will end in a "stupid death," but believes that their life and death will have meaning for themselves and others if they follow the doctrine of Jesus.
- The author criticizes those who pray, observe sacraments, and give charity, but do not truly follow Jesus' example, as their actions are inspired by a different doctrine, and notes that people are stuck in earthly thinking, prioritizing faith over works and quietism, as mentioned in the Upanishads.
- The author argues that people hide from their true situation and do not desire to know the truth that governs human life, instead living without truth and being convinced that seeking truth is a useless occupation, using examples such as the Cobra at the door and falling from the Empire State building to illustrate the need for diligence.
- The author questions why life is full of evil and wrongdoing, and whether it is possible to abstain from participating in it, but is told that the only option is to save one's soul for the future life, and that trying to live well and help others is seen as a temptation of pride.
- The author notes that they are faced with a contradiction, where they are told to either believe in and obey the powers that be, or to renounce the world and take refuge in a convent or monastery, but believes that this is not in line with the spirit of [[Christianity]] or the [[Judaism | Jewish religion]].
- The author criticizes the tradition that it is better for a person to retire from the world than to expose themselves to temptations, and argues that this belief is foreign to the spirit of Christianity and the Jewish religion.
- The author highlights the suffering endured by men in following the doctrine of the world, but notes that there is little suffering in behalf of the doctrine of [[Jesus]], and argues that the fear of suffering is a puerile excuse that shows how little people really know of Jesus' doctrine.
- The author concludes that Jesus' command to take up the cross and follow him is not being followed, and that people are not taking his doctrine seriously, instead using the fear of suffering as an excuse not to follow his teachings.

## Following the Teachings of Jesus vs. Societal Values
- The text discusses the idea that people are more willing to follow orders from a man in a uniform, even if it leads to suffering and death, than to follow the teachings of Jesus, which emphasize the importance of living a simple and humble life.
- It highlights the societal values of power, domination, and abundance of worldly goods, and how these values are in contrast to the teachings of Jesus, which state that true happiness does not depend on fortune and power, and that the rich cannot enter into the kingdom of [[God]].
- The text also critiques the idea that people can make their [[Existence | existence]] secure through material possessions and worldly pursuits, comparing it to the act of an ostrich hiding its head in the sand, and instead suggests that the doctrine of [[Jesus]], which teaches that life is insecure and that one must be ready to die at any moment, is preferable.
- The author describes the benefits of living a poor and simple life, as taught by Jesus, including living in the country, working outdoors, and being free from the burdens of material wealth, and argues that this type of life is a condition for following the doctrine of Jesus and entering into the kingdom of God.
- The text references the writings of [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]] and the concept of Maya, and also mentions the idea that one can still practice the teachings of Jesus, such as the five commandments, regardless of their beliefs in other religious doctrines.
- Ultimately, the text emphasizes the importance of living a life of non-enmity and non-resistance, as taught by Jesus, and suggests that this is the key to true happiness and fulfillment.

## Personal Transformation and the Importance of Humility
- The author of the text has undergone a significant transformation in their perspective, where they can no longer foster anger and pride, and instead recognize their own guilt and seek to make peace with others, as they have come to understand that their previous judgmental and angry attitude towards others was the principal source of their disagreements.
- The author notes that they have been influenced by the ideas of Vivekananda and Tolstoy, who emphasize the importance of humility and recognizing the value of all individuals, and as a result, they have begun to remedy their judgmental attitude and now believe that true greatness lies in humility and serving others.
- The author's newfound understanding has led them to reevaluate their values, and they now consider things like honors, glory, wealth, and luxury to be wrong and despicable, while simplicity, poverty, and humility have become right and important to them, and they can no longer support anything that lifts them above or separates them from others.
- The author has also come to realize that the distinction they once made between their own people and those of other countries is destructive to their welfare, and that true welfare is only possible when they recognize their fellowship with the whole world, leading them to believe in the importance of cosmopolitanism and the renunciation of nationality.
- As a result of this transformation, the author's views on issues like love of country, military exploits, and self-defense have changed, and they now believe that even in the face of evil or foreign invasion, they should not defend themselves, but instead recognize that their enemies are also human beings who are seeking salvation, and that the evil they do can ultimately only be good for the author.

## Chesterton's Orthodoxy: Wonder and Welcome
- The section from the document 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal' features quotes from GK Chesterton's book 'Orthodoxy', which emphasizes the importance of revealing the truth and doing good to all people, regardless of their nationality or background.
- According to Chesterton, a person who is dependent on the luxuries of life is corrupt, and the main problem is finding a balance between being astonished at the world and feeling at home in it, which can be achieved by combining a sense of wonder with a sense of welcome.
- Chesterton also discusses the idea that people need a life of practical romance, which involves a combination of something strange and something secure, and that this can be achieved by viewing the world with a sense of wonder and an idea of welcome.
- He criticizes thoroughly worldly people for not understanding the world and relying on cynical maxims that are not true, and argues that [[Christianity]] is not about being comfortable or cowardly, but rather about finding a balance between admiring nature and not imitating it.
- Chesterton also explores the relationship between [[God]] and humanity, and argues that if it is true that people can feel happiness in doing harmful things, then the religious philosopher must either deny the [[Existence | existence]] of God or the present union between God and humanity.
- Additionally, he discusses the role of imagination and reason in human thought, arguing that imagination does not breed insanity, but rather reason can lead to madness, and that creative artists are less likely to go mad than mathematicians or chess-players.
- Overall, the quotes from Chesterton's 'Orthodoxy' emphasize the importance of finding a balance between wonder and welcome, and of living a life that is guided by a sense of morality and a connection to something greater than oneself.

## Mental Exhaustion and the Flaws of Materialism
- The text discusses the concept of mental exhaustion and the characteristics of individuals with mental disorders, noting that they often possess a "horrible clarity of detail" and are able to argue with great logic, unhampered by emotions or a sense of humor, which can make them more convincing in arguments than people with good judgment.
- The author criticizes the modern scientific society for discouraging people from thinking about death and for promoting a materialistic worldview that has an "insane simplicity" and fails to account for the complexities and mysteries of human experience, leaving out important aspects of life such as hope, courage, and poetry.
- The text argues that materialism can lead to a loss of humanity, destroying essential human qualities like kindness, hope, and courage, and that it can result in fatalism, which is not a liberating force, and instead, it takes away people's freedom to make choices and act with purpose.
- The author suggests that reason, when used without a connection to the world and human experience, can be a sign of insanity, and that the modern critics of religious authority are misguided in their attacks, as they fail to recognize the importance of faith and the role of religious authority in protecting humanity from the dangers of unchecked reason and the void of [[Nihilism | nihilism]].
- The text also touches on the idea that reason itself is a matter of faith, and that it is impossible to separate reason from faith, as even the most skeptical individuals must have faith in the idea that their thoughts have some relation to [[Existence | reality]], and that the concept of evolution, when taken to its logical conclusion, can be seen as an attack on rationalism rather than religion.

## The Importance of Objective Truth and the Dangers of Unchecked Reason
- The text discusses the idea that if everything is in a state of flux and there are no fixed things, then it is impossible to think or have a standard to measure improvement, as argued by philosophers like Nietzsche, who claimed that what was once considered good is now considered evil.
- The author agrees with pragmatists that apparent objective truth is not the only consideration, but argues that a belief in objective truth is necessary for the human mind, and that without it, one cannot rebel against anything or have a standard to measure improvement.
- The author criticizes philosophers like Schopenhauer, Tolstoy, Nietzsche, and Shaw, arguing that their philosophies lead to mental helplessness and madness, and that they have lost their right to rebel against anything by rebelling against everything.
- The author also discusses the idea that some philosophers, like Tolstoy and Nietzsche, have noble qualities, but that these qualities are often undermined by their own actions or inconsistencies, and that historical figures like [[Joan of Arc]] embody the best qualities of these philosophers, such as a reverence for the poor and a willingness to take action.
- The author argues that there is no inconsistency between having love for humanity and having hatred for inhumanity, and that the idea that the laws of nature are unalterable is a form of magic that is not supported by scientific evidence, but rather by sentimental associations.
- The author concludes that the ordinary scientific man is a sentimentalist who is swept away by associations, rather than being guided by reason or objective truth, and that this approach to science and philosophy is flawed and leads to mental helplessness and madness.

## The Human Condition and the Need for Both Optimism and Pessimism
- The author reflects on the human condition, noting that people have forgotten who they are and that understanding the self is more challenging than understanding the cosmos, as expressed in the phrase "thou shalt love [[God | the Lord]] thy God; but thou shalt not know thyself."
- The author discusses the concept of modern thought contradicting the basic creed of his boyhood, which was founded on fairy tales that taught him to be modest and submit to the limitations of a wild and delightful world.
- The author argues that a person must be able to both love and hate the world, being a fanatical pessimist and optimist at the same time, in order to truly change it, and that this combination is what makes a rational optimist fail and an irrational optimist succeed.
- The author criticizes the idea that certain creeds or philosophies can only be held in specific ages or times, stating that this is an "imbecile habit" and that truth is timeless, as evidenced by the statement "you might as well say that a certain philosophy can be believed on Mondays, but cannot be believed on Tuesdays."
- The author recounts their personal journey from calling themselves an optimist to realizing that [[Christianity | Christian]] optimism is based on the fact that humans do not fit into the world, and that this realization brought them true happiness, as they learned that "man is a monstrosity" and that this unnaturalness is what makes life poetic.
- The author notes that Christianity is often misunderstood as being either too pessimistic or too optimistic, but that it actually combines furious opposites, such as the desire for life and the acceptance of death, as seen in the statement "he must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it; he must desire life like water and yet drink death like wine."
- The author highlights the example of St. Francis and St. Jerome, who were able to express both extreme optimism and pessimism because they kept their passions in balance, with St. Francis being a "shouting optimist" and St. Jerome being able to "paint the world blacker than Schopenhauer."

## Spiritual Detachment and the Dark Night of the Soul
- The provided text discusses the concept of spirituality and the importance of detaching oneself from worldly desires, with quotes from St. [[John of the Cross]] and references to his work "The [[Dark Night of the Soul]]", emphasizing that a person who is dependent on the luxuries of life is corrupt in various aspects.
- According to the text, the doctrine of [[Jesus | Christ]] teaches contempt for all worldly things, allowing individuals to receive the reward of the [[Holy Spirit | Spirit of God]], and it is stated that the earth and all its contents are nothing compared to [[God]], and that the heavens' lights are perfect darkness in comparison.
- The text also explains that when an individual's affections are set on created things, they are considered nothing before God, and that love for anything other than God can be seen as wronging Him, highlighting the idea that created things hinder transformation in God and are less than nothing, much like darkness is the absence of light.
- Additionally, the text notes that once an individual has experienced the sweetness of the Spirit, worldly desires become unappealing, and that God leads people to perfection through their natural constitution, guiding them from what is vile and exterior to what is interior and noble.
- The text reiterates the idea that all created things, along with the affections bestowed upon them, are nothing and hinder transformation in God, using the analogy of darkness and light to illustrate that the soul focused on creatures will never comprehend God, emphasizing the need for spiritual detachment and focus on the divine.
- The text emphasizes that until one's soul is purged of worldly affections, they will not be able to possess God in this life through the pure transformation of love, nor in the afterlife through the beatific vision, as stated in the document 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal'.
- According to the text, the whole creation is nothing compared to the infinite Being of God, and a soul whose affections are set on created things is considered nothing and even less than nothing before God, because love begets equality and likeness to the object beloved.
- The text highlights that all the goodness, sweetness, and riches of the world are, in comparison to God's infinite goodness, supreme wickedness, pain, and poverty, and that a soul whose affections are set on these things is wicked, poor, and mean in God's sight.
- The Divine Wisdom, as mentioned in the text, bewails men because they make themselves loathsome and poor through their love for worldly things, and [[God]] addresses those who set their affections on these things, calling them little ones and bidding them to understand subtlety and take notice of the great things of God.
- The text emphasizes that it is supreme ignorance to think that one can attain union with God without casting away the desire for natural and supernatural things, and that the doctrine of [[Jesus | Christ]] is contempt of all things, so that one may receive the reward of the [[Holy Spirit | Spirit of God]].
- The text also notes that many spiritual persons seek spiritual food but are not content with God alone, instead intermingling carnal and earthly satisfactions, and that they are losing the good things of the Spirit because they will not raise their desires above trifles.
- Ultimately, the text concludes that the journey to union with God must be a perpetual struggle with one's desires, and that the more earnest one is, the sooner they will reach the summit, as guided by the principles outlined in 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal'.

## Spiritual Transformation and the Cessation of Desires
- The attainment of spiritual perfection requires the cessation of desires, as virtue is not fully acquired until the soul is empty, detached, and purified from all desire, according to the principles outlined in the text.
- To reach the state of perfection, one must fulfill the three commandments of Jacob, which involve casting away earthly affections and attachments, purifying oneself from the impressions of desires, and changing one's garments, symbolizing a transformation of the soul.
- The process of spiritual transformation is facilitated by [[God]], who infuses the soul with a new understanding and love of God, detaching the will from old desires and human satisfactions, and bringing the soul into a state of new knowledge and deep delight.
- The ultimate goal of this spiritual journey is to become an altar of God, where the soul offers the sacrifice of praise and love, and God alone dwells, as stated in the text, "It is the will of God that the soul should be empty of all created things, so that it may become a fitting altar of His Majesty."

## Faith as a Dark Night and the Path to Union with God
- The text also highlights the importance of faith, which is described as a dark night that gives light to the soul, and the role of darkness in illuminating the soul, as expressed in the phrase "the night of faith shall guide me," emphasizing the idea that faith is a means of enlightenment, even in the midst of darkness.
- The teaching presented in the text suggests that the faith, which is obscure and dark, can illuminate the soul and guide it towards union with God, as stated in the Psalmist's words, "Night shall be my light in my pleasures," referring to the pleasures of pure contemplation and union with God.
- The soul must be in darkness to have light and journey on the spiritual road, as stated in "The Abyss of Faith", and this darkness refers to the soul's detachment from its own understanding, sense, imagination, judgment, and will, in order to be rightly guided by faith.
- The soul is greatly embarrassed on the road to Divine union when it leans on its own understanding, sense, imagination, judgment, or will, and it must release and detach itself from these habits to attain the divine union.
- To achieve this union, the soul must be detached from all created things, actions, and capabilities of its own, including its own understanding, taste, and feeling, so that it can attain to the receiving of God's likeness and be transformed in Him.
- The more the soul cleaves to created things and relies on its own strength, the less it is disposed for this union, because it does not completely resign itself into the hands of [[God]], and the fitting disposition for this union is pureness and love, which is perfect resignation and complete detachment from all things for God alone.

## Degrees of Union with God and the Role of Detachment
- Every soul can attain to this union according to its measure, but not all attain to it in an equal degree, and the degree of union is determined by God, with some souls being more advanced than others, yet all equally satisfied according to their dispositions and knowledge of God.
- The soul that does not attain to the degree of purity corresponding with the light and vocation it has received from God will never obtain true peace and contentment, because it has not attained to the detachment and emptiness of its powers required for this pure union.
- Faith, Hope, and Charity all play a role in this process, with Faith deriving certainty but not clearness, Hope rendering the memory empty and bringing darkness, and Charity emptying the will of all things and compelling us to love God above all, which requires withdrawing our affections from every object to fix them wholly upon God.
- [[Jesus | Christ]] our Lord has stated that to be His disciple, one must renounce all possessions, and that virtues can bring darkness to the soul if they are not accompanied by detachment from created things, as He says, "Every one of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth cannot be My disciple."
- Our Lord also teaches that the path to life is narrow and few find it, and that to enter this path, one must constrain themselves and detach their will from worldly things, loving [[God]] above all, which is referred to as the night of the senses, as He says, "How narrow is the gate and strait is the way that leadeth to life; and few there are that find it."
- Many people mistakenly believe that simply retiring from the world, correcting excesses, or practicing virtue and mortification is enough, but true detachment and emptiness of spirit, as recommended by our Saviour, require a deeper level of self-denial and poverty, which involves annihilating oneself and purging away all self-seeking in spiritual things.
- Those who do not rise to this level of detachment often seek only delights and sweet communications with God, rather than true self-denial and detachment of spirit, which is actually a form of spiritual gluttony, and they render themselves spiritually enemies of the cross of Christ.
- True spirituality, on the other hand, seeks bitterness rather than sweetness in God, inclines to suffering more than consolation, and seeks to be in want of everything for God, rather than possessing, and this is to follow Christ and deny self, as opposed to seeking oneself in God, which is the opposite of love.
- To seek God in Himself is to be willingly deprived of comfort and refreshment from God, and to incline oneself to will and choose whatever is most disagreeable for Christ's sake, whether proceeding from God or the world, which is to love God, and this is the true meaning of carrying the cross and seeking refreshment and sweetness in it.
- Ultimately, giving oneself up to suffer for Christ's sake and annihilating oneself utterly is the sum and root of all virtue, and without this exercise, all other efforts will be profitless, notwithstanding great meditations and communications, as our Saviour teaches us to seek and endure the cross in everything for God.

## The Imitation of Christ and the Limits of Human Understanding
- The attainment of spiritual progress and union with [[God]] is only possible through [[The Imitation of Christ | the imitation of Christ]], and this union is the highest and noblest state that can be achieved in life, as stated in the quote "there is no progress but in the imitation of [[Jesus | Christ]]".
- According to the text, many people who consider themselves friends of Jesus Christ are actually seeking their own comfort and satisfaction in Him, rather than His sufferings and death, and therefore do not truly know Him, as mentioned by the statement "I see that Jesus Christ is but little known by those who consider themselves His friends".
- The intellect and human understanding are limited and cannot fully comprehend God, and in fact, the more one tries to understand God through human knowledge, the further they will be from true enlightenment, as explained by the quote "all that the intellect may comprehend; all that the will may be satisfied with; and all that the imagination may conceive, is most unlike unto God, and most disproportionate to Him".
- The concept of Mystical Theology, also referred to as the secret Wisdom of God, is a way of contemplating God that involves making oneself blind to human understanding and covering oneself with darkness, in order to receive the Divine enlightening, as described by S. Dionysius as a "ray of darkness".
- Aristotle's comparison of the human intellect to the eyes of a bat in relation to the sun is used to illustrate the idea that human understanding is blinded by the greater Light of God, and that faith is the only means by which God manifests Himself to the soul, as stated by the quote "[[Aristotle]] says, that as the eyes of the bat are with regard to the sun, which wholly blinds them, so is our intellect with regard to the greater Light of God which is to us perfect darkness".
- The text also warns against relying on outward bodily senses, such as seeing, hearing, and smelling, as a means of spiritual guidance, as these can be deceptive and lead to error, presumption, and vanity, and instead emphasizes the importance of faith and interior spiritual experiences, as mentioned by the statement "the bodily sense is as ignorant of spiritual things, as a beast of the field is of the things of reason".
- S. Paul's statement "He that cometh to [[God]] must believe that He is" is referenced to emphasize the importance of faith in approaching God, and the need to walk by faith, with one's understanding in darkness, in order to be united with God, as explained by the quote "the greater the faith of the soul the more is that soul united to God".
- The text concludes that true spiritual growth and union with God can only be achieved by letting go of human understanding and relying on faith, and that this is the only means by which God manifests Himself to the soul in the Divine light, which surpasses all human understanding.

## The Dangers of Materialism and the Importance of Interior Quiet
- The soul is often led astray by its focus on material and palpable things, which excite the senses and cause it to abandon the guidance of Faith in its pursuit of union with God, as it mistakenly believes that the light from these things is a means to achieve its desired union.
- The spiritual man must reject all apprehensions and corporeal satisfactions that are liable to the exterior senses, and instead learn to abide with attention in loving waiting upon God in a state of quiet, giving no heed to imagination or its operations.
- It is sad to see individuals disturb their own souls when they are at peace in interior quiet, where [[God]] fills them with refreshment and peace, by drawing them away to outward things and compelling them to abandon their goal.
- To achieve perfect union with God, the soul must be careful not to lean upon imaginary visions, forms, figures, and particular intelligible objects, as these things can never serve as proportionate or proximate means towards this end and are instead an obstacle in the way.
- Some spiritual persons fall into spiritual wrath when they become irritated at the sins of others and keep watch on them with uneasy zeal, which is contrary to spiritual meekness, as noted by various philosophers and theologians such as [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], Nietzsche, Tolstoy, and Seraphim.
- These individuals have gained some degree of spiritual strength in God, enabling them to refrain from creature desires and suffer a light burden and aridity without turning back, but they are still susceptible to the [[Dark Night of the Soul]], where God turns their light into darkness and leaves them in a state of uncertainty and dryness.
- In this state, they are unable to advance in meditation and find insipidity and bitterness in spiritual things and good exercises, which is a challenging and transformative experience for the soul.

## The Dark Night of the Soul and Spiritual Purgation
- The text describes a spiritual journey where [[God]] allows the soul to experience a "dark night" to quench its sensual desires and purge its attachment to created things, which can be a difficult and trying experience for the soul.
- According to the text, there are signs that indicate a soul is undergoing this purgation, including a lack of pleasure or consolation in the things of God, and a sense of backsliding or not serving God, despite a strong desire to do so.
- The soul is freed from its attachments and desires when it undergoes this night, which brings numerous blessings, including the acquisition of virtues, and allows the soul to journey towards eternal things, which is a great happiness and good fortune.
- The text quotes Our Saviour, referencing the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to life, and explains that the night of sense is the strait gate, where the soul detaches itself from sense and establishes itself in faith, in order to journey towards God in pure faith.
- The text also describes a second night, the night of the spirit, which is darker and more trying than the night of sense, but has greater benefits, including the knowledge of oneself and one's misery, which is the first and principal benefit caused by this arid and dark night of contemplation.
- Ultimately, the soul emerges from this journey with a deeper understanding of its own misery and a greater sense of humility, having been stripped of its attachments and desires, and having been purified through the experience of the dark night.

## Self-Knowledge and the Illuminating Power of Darkness
- The soul, having donned the attire of aridity and abandonment, possesses a deeper understanding of itself through the virtue of self-knowledge, recognizing its own limitations and inability to act on its own, and it is in this state that [[God]] enlightens the soul, granting it knowledge of its lowliness and the greatness of God.
- In this dark night of contemplation, God cleanses and frees the understanding, allowing the soul to comprehend the truth, and it is through this process that the soul is instructed supernaturally by God in His Divine wisdom, as stated by Isaias and experienced by [[David]], who found that the aridities and detachments of his sensual nature were the means to a knowledge of God.
- The dark night, with its aridities and voids, serves as a means to a knowledge of God and oneself, although it is only the beginning of a deeper understanding, and it is through this journey that the soul gains virtues, such as quietism and awareness of the Other, and is protected and delivered from all that is not God.
- As the soul approaches God, it feels a deeper sense of darkness and obscurity due to its own weakness, much like a man approaching the sun, and it is through this dark contemplation that the soul is cured of its afflictions and regains its health, which is God Himself, as described by the Prophet and experienced by those who undergo this spiritual transformation.
- The process of dark contemplation is likened to a cure, where the soul is restricted from worldly desires and appetites, and is instead nourished by a delicate and moderate spiritual diet, allowing it to regain its health and approach God, as stated by Tillich, who says that doubt shows true faith, and as experienced by those who have undergone this spiritual journey.

## The Transcendent Light of God and the Soul's Purgation
- The spiritual light of [[God]] is so immense and transcendent that it can blind and darken those who approach it, causing the soul to feel keenly the shadow of death, lamentations, and pains of hell, as it feels chastised and unworthy of God.
- In this state of purgative contemplation, the soul experiences a profound emptiness and impoverishment of temporal, natural, and spiritual goods, and is surrounded by miseries of imperfection, aridity, and emptiness, leading to a consciousness of its own deepest poverty and wretchedness.
- God brings about this dark contemplation to purge the soul of its affections and imperfect habits, annihilating and emptying it of all that is imperfect, much like fire consumes the mouldiness and rust of metal, and this process is a most afflictive suffering for the soul.
- The soul's suffering is so great that it feels as though it is being suspended in the air, unable to breathe, and it believes that its director's advice contains no remedy for its troubles, leaving it feeling powerless and imprisoned in a dark dungeon, unable to move or see.
- The soul's only hope for relief is for the Lord to completely purge it in the manner that He wills, and until then, no means or remedy is of any service or profit, and the purgation will be of greater or less severity and duration in proportion to the degree of union of love that God's mercy grants it.
- The Prophet describes this process as a necessary destruction of the soul's passions and imperfections, which have become natural to it, in order for it to be purified and annihilated, and ultimately become one with the [[Holy Spirit | Spirit of God]], according to the degree of union of love that is granted to it.

## The Dark Night of the Soul and the Abyss of Faith
- The text discusses the concept of a "dark night" where the soul is unable to raise its affection or mind to [[God]] and is hindered by distractions and forgetfulness, as described in Chapter 7 of the second book, and this experience is characterized by a sense of emptiness and disconnection from God.
- According to Divine [[Religious text | Scripture]], this journey to God is secret and different from human knowledge, and it involves losing oneself and becoming nothing, which is often considered the worst thing possible, but is actually a necessary step towards union with God.
- The text also quotes Fr. [[Seraphim Rose]], who emphasizes that everything in life is temporary and only God remains, and that humans have a choice to follow the way of the world or to choose God, and that the Christian's "[[Nihilism | nihilism]]" is one that proceeds from abundance, where God is all and the world is nothing.
- Fr. Seraphim Rose also notes that the [[Christianity | Christian]] can enjoy the goods of the world while realizing their evanescence, but they are not needful, and that those who do not live in [[Jesus | Christ]] already live in the Abyss and cannot fill their emptiness with worldly treasures, and that men often learn through pain and suffering rather than pleasure and happiness.
- The text references various spiritual leaders and philosophers, including Jeremias, Tillich, and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], and highlights the importance of letting go of particular forms and conceptions to be united with God, as stated in the quote "As God is not comprehended under any form, or likeness, or particular conception, so the soul also, if it is to be united to Him, must not be under the power of any particular form or conception".
- The concept of pleasure and happiness can lead individuals to become satisfied with the world as it is, whereas pain and suffering can drive them to seek a more profound happiness beyond the limitations of the world, as noted in the discussion of the human experience.
- The idea of a Nihilist universe, as described by philosophers like Nietzsche, is one where there is no absolute truth, no right or wrong, and no point of orientation, leaving individuals without a sense of direction or purpose.
- The Nihilist perspective is characterized by a sense of meaninglessness and futility, with some individuals being aware of this emptiness and being driven to madness and suicide, while others lead seemingly meaningless lives without being aware of it, highlighting the complexities of the human condition.

## The Relativity of Truth and the Metaphysical First Principle
- The notion that all truth is empirical or relative is self-contradictory, as statements like these are themselves not empirical but metaphysical, and absolute statements cannot be relative, as argued in the critique of relativism.
- The scientific faith, which is based on principles like the coherence and uniformity of nature, is founded on absolute truth, and if these principles are not rooted in truth, they can be no more than unverifiable probabilities, as discussed in the examination of the foundations of scientific knowledge.
- The concept of ultimate truth, whether conceived as the [[Christianity | Christian]] [[God]] or the ultimate coherence of things, is a metaphysical first principle that collapses the theory of the relativity of truth, revealing it as a self-contradictory absolute, as explained in the discussion of metaphysics and epistemology.
- Many individuals in academic institutions, government, science, and humanist intellectual circles do not fully believe in absolute truth, or more particularly in Christian Truth, but still use the name of truth, having reinterpreted it to fit a quasi-Nihilist content, as observed in the analysis of contemporary intellectual trends.
- The atheist arguments against the concept of God are considered irrefutable but irrelevant, as the god being argued against is, in fact, no god at all, being uninterested in man and powerless to act in the world, as noted in the critique of atheistic perspectives.
- Nietzsche is mentioned as a prophet who knew everything about [[Nihilism]] except its ultimate meaning, highlighting the complexities and nuances of his philosophical thought, and the Realists of the free world are criticized for transforming and simplifying the [[Christian tradition]] into a system for promoting worldly progress, as discussed in the examination of the relationship between philosophy and culture.

## Liberalism, Nihilism, and the Christian Order
- The foundation of Liberalism is flawed, as it is built upon the concept of Man rather than a higher deity, and this foundation is also embraced by Nihilist atheism, which explicitly formulates the implicit ideas present in Liberalism, as noted by philosophers such as Tillich and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- In the [[Christianity | Christian]] order, all activities are judged in the light of the afterlife, which is eternal, and any compromise between Christian terminology and worldliness is unconvincing to both Orthodox Christians and consistent Nihilists, as seen in the works of Dostoyevsky and the character of Ivan Karamazov.
- The Liberal belief that one can lead a civilized life without immortality is flawed, as it ultimately leads to the conclusion that "all things are lawful" and that life has no ultimate consequence, a idea also explored by Nietzsche, and this worldview is in stark contrast to the views of Tolstoy on anarchy.
- Nihilist rule, or Anarchy, is a government established by men with no higher aim than earthly happiness, and the Revolution that accompanies it will not rest until it ends in a totalitarian Kingdom of this world, highlighting the dangers of a system that rejects Divine Truth.
- The Liberal is more interested in worldly ends and is indifferent to the [[Existence | reality]] of Heaven and Hell, conceiving of [[God]] as a vague impersonal power, and is unable or unwilling to think in terms of ultimate things, as they are consumed by their pursuit of culture, learning, business, or comfort.
- The search for absolute truth is absent in the Liberal, who is overburdened by worldly interests and ideas, and is unwilling to give them up for the humility and poverty that are the marks of a genuine seeker after truth, as noted by philosophers such as [[Socrates]] and [[Jesus | Jesus Christ]], who is referred to as "the Way, the Truth, and the Life".
- The academic system that promotes skepticism and irrelevance of Christian Truth is corrupting, and the evil lies primarily in the system itself, which is founded upon untruth, rather than in the individual professors who preach it, highlighting the need for a re-evaluation of the values and principles that underlie our understanding of the world.

## Nihilism, Realism, and the Rejection of Christian Truth
- The concept of [[Nihilism]] is being redefined in the context of the text, where a True Nihilist is described as someone who respects nothing, rejects authority, and accepts only scientific truth, reducing everything to the physical and material.
- In contrast to Liberalism, the Realist worldview is characterized by open atheism, materialism, and self-interest, with a rejection of idealism and abstraction in favor of concrete and factual knowledge, which is referred to as "scientism" rather than legitimate science.
- The text references various thinkers, including [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], Tolstoy, and Underhill, and argues that those who take scientific knowledge as the only truth and deny what lies above it can be considered Nihilists in the exact sense of the term.
- The author criticizes the "pretended humility" of Realist scholars and scientists, who are seen as usurping the throne of [[God]] with their emphasis on scientific research over Divine Revelation, and notes that the difference between Realism and Liberalism lies not in doctrine, but in emphasis and motivation.
- The text also discusses the philosophy of Nietzsche, who rebelled against a diluted form of [[Christianity]] that had been influenced by Liberal humanism, and argues that both Christians and Realists share a love of truth and a passion for getting to the root of things, but differ in their approach and ultimate goals.
- Ultimately, the author suggests that the Realist worldview, which is characterized by a fanatical devotion to the material world, is a form of Nihilism that mistakes Christianity for another form of idealism and rejects it in favor of a solely materialistic perspective.

## Materialism, Atheism, and Vitalism
- The text discusses the concepts of materialism, atheism, and realism, stating that even the most charitable views cannot recognize a love of truth in these ideologies, as they have become misguided and ultimately lead to the negation of truth.
- The motives of realists are deemed impure, as they prioritize worldly values over truth, and their actions serve to annihilate higher truths concerning [[God]] and the spiritual life, with logical [[Positivism | positivism]] being a key aspect of this movement.
- The text also explores the concept of vitalism, which is characterized by a rejection of [[Christianity | Christian]] truth and a pseudo-spiritual pretension, often manifesting as a "new spirituality" that is actually a form of [[Nihilism | nihilism]] that attaches itself to healthy organisms to destroy them from within.
- Various forms of popular unrest are identified, including the passion for movement and speed, the appeal of television and cinema, the primitive character of popular music, and the cult of physical prowess in sport, all of which serve as escapes from the emptiness and meaninglessness that result from abandoning God and revealed truth.
- The cult of "awareness" and "realization" is also seen as a form of vitalism, present in the devotees of modern art, [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], and the supposed "religious experience" stimulated by drugs, although the author notes that these experiences may be steps towards symbolism and a connection to God.
- The text concludes by highlighting the need to define vitalism and expose its nihilist character, which is distinct from liberalism and realism, as it undermines truth through indifference and attacks it in the name of a lesser, partial truth, with key figures such as W.B. Yeats, Huxley, and Tyndall being mentioned as examples of these ideologies.

## Vitalism, Nihilism, and the Death of God
- The concept of Vitalism is discussed as having no relation to truth, instead focusing on a different order, and is revealed to be infecting humanism with its strange axiom that the "love of truth" is never-ending because it can never be fulfilled, leading to a constant search for something that may never be found.
- This attitude is criticized as a way for unbelievers to hide their abandonment of truth behind noble rhetoric, and is linked to the ideas of Nietzsche, who said that to be creative, one must first destroy and smash accepted values, which is a key principle of [[Nihilism]].
- The "death of [[God]]" is explained as a loss of faith in God and the Divine Truth that once sustained humanity, leading to an apostasy to worldliness and a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, which is characterized as an abyss of nothingness.
- The idea of Nihilism is explored as a state of being without truth, where the individual has lost faith in God and the Divine, and is left with a sense of nothingness and uncertainty, which is self-contradictory and suicidal.
- The question is raised as to what the god of the Nihilist is, and it is suggested that it is nothingness itself, the "corpse" of the "dead God", which weighs upon the Nihilist and leads to a sense of incoherence and absurdity in the world.
- The text also references Nietzsche's famous statement "God is dead" and explores the implications of this idea, including the feeling of emptiness and disorientation that comes with it, as expressed in the passage "We have killed him, you and I, we are all his murderers".
- The summary concludes by highlighting the idea that humanity is left without a sense of direction or purpose, feverishly pursuing the work of "progress" without a clear reason or sense of direction, and instead straying through infinite nothingness.

## Nihilism as a Spiritual Disorder
- The concept of [[Nihilism | nihilism]] is described as a spiritual disorder that can only be overcome by spiritual means, and it is described as the absolute despotism of worldliness where all human energy is devoted to worldly concerns, with the ultimate goal of production and happiness in this world.
- The idea of seeking [[Christianity | Christian]] ideals in this world is considered idolatry and of [[The Antichrist (book) | the Antichrist]], and it is emphasized that the end of the Church is the transformation of men, not society, with the Church being in society only because men are in society.
- The importance of spiritual means in overcoming nihilism is highlighted, and it is noted that there has been no attempt to apply such means in the contemporary world, leading to a sense of emptiness and desperation, as expressed in the personal feelings of unworthiness and the search for meaning.
- The concept of "total peace" is considered a utopian ideal, and it is questioned whether it is possible to achieve, with the distinction between earthly and otherworldly goals being emphasized, as seen in the ideas of [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- The idea of "Christian action" is discussed, with the emphasis being on the importance of living a Christian life in all aspects, including social and political responsibilities, but not with the goal of creating a Christian society, rather as a natural result of Christian men living in society, as seen in the words of [[Thomas Merton]].
- The personal and direct act of helping others, such as feeding a hungry brother, is considered a Christian act and a preaching of the Kingdom, done for personal reasons and as a recognition of the brother as [[Jesus | Christ]], highlighting the importance of individual actions and relationships in living a Christian life.

## Christian Action and the True Kingdom of God
- The text discusses the concept of a "political crusade" to abolish social evils, such as hunger, and how it can be wrapped in a cloak of "idealism" that prioritizes worldly ideals over spiritual truth, as noted by Vivekananda in [[Karma yoga | Karma Yoga]].
- The author cautions that even sincere Christians participating in such crusades may be obscuring inward truth by emphasizing outward ideals, and that this approach can lead to a denial of the true Kingdom of [[God]], which is not of this world.
- The author quotes [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], who emphasizes the importance of Karma Yoga, and notes that the emphasis on "action" and "projects" can detract from the acceptance of God's will and the realization of inward truth.
- The central need of our time, according to the author, is not political commitments or social responsibilities, but rather prayer, penance, fasting, and preaching of the true Kingdom, as emphasized by [[Jesus | Christ]], and that the only "social responsibility" of a [[Christianity | Christian]] is to live a life of faith for their own salvation and as an example to others.
- The author criticizes a "new Christianity" that prioritizes outward results and seeks to build a Kingdom in the world, rather than seeking the true Kingdom of God, which is not of this world, and notes that Christianity can only be "successful" if it renounces the true Kingdom and seeks to build a worldly kingdom instead.
- The author argues that true Christianity is not about achieving outward success or transforming the world, but rather about living a life of faith and allowing God's will to be done, and that even charitable actions, such as building hospitals and bridges, can be misguided if they are motivated by a desire for worldly results rather than a desire to serve God.

## The Earthly Kingdom vs. Christ's Kingdom
- The modern age is focused on building the "Earthly Kingdom", a goal that is not Christian, and many Christians, including Catholics and Orthodox, are unintentionally contributing to its construction with the best of intentions.
- The author criticizes "prophets" like Berdyaev and Tolstoy, who are considered semi- or pseudo-Christians, and believes that true Christians must prioritize the central problem of humanity, which is death and its answer, [[Jesus | Christ]], over worldly concerns.
- The author argues that Christians who genuinely believe in and live according to their faith, including the concept of an "other world", have something new and meaningful to offer contemporary society, which is often disillusioned with [[Christianity]] due to its perceived hypocrisy and idealism.
- The involvement of Christians in social idealism projects is seen as a compromise, where they prioritize building a worldly kingdom over Christ's Kingdom, which is a refinement of the "Grand Inquisitor" concept from Dostoyevsky's work.
- The author emphasizes the need for Christians to focus on spiritual disciplines like prayer, penance, and fasting, rather than getting caught up in worldly activities, and to live their lives with a deep love for [[God]] and zeal for His Kingdom, which would naturally lead to positive outcomes.
- The author also references the writings of [[Teresa of Ávila | Theresa of Avila]], who describes a profound spiritual experience of being in a "world of light" and laments having to return to the worldly realm after experiencing heavenly conversation, highlighting the contrast between the spiritual and worldly realms.

## Spiritual Longing and the Search for God
- The given text appears to be a collection of quotes and passages from various spiritual and philosophical sources, including [[Augustine of Hippo | Augustine]], Tolstoy, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], Huxley, and Teresa, that express a sense of disillusionment and discontent with the worldly life and a yearning for a deeper connection with God.
- The quotes convey a sense of frustration and desperation, with the speakers feeling trapped in a "prison-house life" filled with "vexation, and disappointment, and manifold trouble", and seeking solace in the idea of turning inward to find God and true fulfillment.
- The passages also emphasize the importance of humility, compassion, and selflessness, with Teresa's conception of humility being particularly strict, and the need to let go of worldly attachments and desires in order to attain true blessedness and union with [[God]].
- The text also touches on the idea of original sin and its consequences, with the speaker reflecting on the "great hurt" it has done to humanity, leading to a sense of alienation and inability to connect with God, and acknowledging that it is not just Adam's sin, but also one's own sin that contributes to this state.
- The quotes from various sources, including Solitude, suggest that one can find God and experience divine comfort and guidance by settling oneself in solitude and turning inward, rather than seeking external sources of comfort or trying to escape the difficulties of life.
- The overall tone of the text is one of spiritual longing and seeking, with the speakers expressing a deep desire to transcend the limitations and sufferings of the worldly life and to experience a more profound and meaningful connection with God.

- The quotes discuss the importance of proper preparation for prayer, including meditation on the life and death of the Lord, one's own death, and the last day, in order to reach a state of spiritual enlightenment and connection with God.
- The speaker describes the experience of mystical prayer, where one feels engulfed in God's presence and enjoys a sense of love and rapture without fully understanding it, and distinguishes this from ordinary prayer, where one is more aware of their thoughts and actions.
- The quotes also emphasize the importance of humility and self-mortification in attaining supernatural prayer, and advise against seeking advancement or worldly pleasures, instead encouraging a life of simplicity and detachment.

- The document concludes with a note of caution, advising that the contents should only be shared with spiritual persons of exceptional experience and prudence, as they may be misunderstood or misinterpreted by others, and the speaker expresses humility and self-doubt about their own ability to write about such profound spiritual matters.

## Detachment from Worldly Things and Self-Indulgence
- The section from the document 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal' emphasizes the importance of detachment from worldly things and self-indulgence in order to truly serve [[God | the Lord]], with the ultimate goal of achieving freedom and perfection.
- It highlights that attachment to relatives and personal desires is a significant obstacle to overcome, and that one must constantly remind themselves of the vanity and fleeting nature of all things to withdraw their affections from trivial matters and fix them on what is eternal.

- The text also touches on the idea that progress in spiritual growth is not measured by the number of consolations or favors received from [[God]], but rather by the desire to grow and to stimulate a longing for spiritual things, and that this longing can be so strong that it can lead to a kind of spiritual death, which is considered happy.
- The author references "The Interior Castle" and notes that the gate to entering this castle is prayer and meditation, and that it is important to understand one's own nature and the gifts of the soul, rather than just focusing on worldly things.

## Perseverance, Faith, and the Struggle Between Worldly and Spiritual Desires

- The text concludes by noting that [[God]] is both the only comfort and the supreme terror, and that meeting the gaze of absolute goodness is not something to be taken lightly, but rather something that should inspire a sense of awe and reverence.

## The Human Condition, Reality, and Christianity

- The quotes suggest that people need to confront the harsh realities of life, including the possibility that our existence is desperate and that the truth is often terrifying, and that Christianity offers a way to understand and find comfort in the face of these realities, as noted by the author who says that the Christian religion is a thing of unspeakable comfort, but it begins in dismay.
- The quotes also touch on the idea that our perception of reality and human [[Existence | existence]] is flawed, with the author questioning the nature of consciousness and why we are able to see and understand the harsh realities of life, and also wondering if reality is meaningless to us, or if we are simply unable to understand it, as expressed in the phrase "if reality at its very root is so meaningless to us".
- The author further explores the idea that the pain and suffering we experience in life, including grief and agony, must eventually subside, but questions what will follow, suggesting that it may be a state of apathy or boredom, and poses the question of whether grief finally subsides into boredom tinged by faint nausea.
- The quotes also raise questions about the existence and nature of [[God]], with the author suggesting that if the tortures and suffering we experience are unnecessary, then either there is no God or God is bad, highlighting the difficulty of reconciling the existence of evil and suffering with the idea of a benevolent deity.

## Despair and the Sickness Unto Death
- The concept of despair and [[The Sickness unto Death | the sickness unto death]] is discussed in the context of [[Christianity]], with quotes from Kierkegaard's "Sickness Unto Death" highlighting the importance of recognizing and embracing despair as a necessary step towards faith.
- According to [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], the natural man is ignorant of what the dreadful truly is, yet he shudders at things that are not dreadful, and he worships an idol as God, which is not the same as knowing the true God.
- The ability to despair is seen as an infinite advantage, as it allows individuals to become eternally and decisively conscious of themselves as spirit, as self, and to become aware of the fact that there is a God, and that they exist before this God.
- Kierkegaard notes that everyone, to some extent, is in despair, with a disquietude, perturbation, or anxious dread of an unknown something, and that only true Christians are not in despair, as they have found a way to lose themselves in order to gain themselves through the aid of the eternal.
- The Christian perspective on despair and the sickness unto death is unique, as it views death as a transition unto life, and therefore, there is no earthly, bodily sickness unto death from a Christian standpoint.
- The sickness unto death is a concept that must be understood in a peculiar sense, as it refers to a spiritual sickness that can only be healed through Christianity, and the possibility of this sickness is seen as man's advantage over the beast, allowing for sharp observation and eventual healing.
- The quotes from Kierkegaard, as well as references to other thinkers such as Seraphim, Smith, and Huxley, emphasize the terrifying nature of the experience of despair, which is often referred to as "hell" by mystics and other spiritual leaders.
- Ultimately, the ability to despair and to become aware of [[The Sickness unto Death | the sickness unto death]] is seen as a necessary step towards faith and spiritual growth, and the Christian's advantage over the natural man lies in their ability to think dauntlessly of everything earthly and worldly, including death.

## The Despair of Not Being Able to Die
- The concept of despair is discussed as a state where one hopes for death as a means of escape, but is unable to die, and this feeling of being trapped is considered one of the most awful experiences, as noted by Cioran and Tillich in their works, including "Courage" by Tillich on page 11.
- The idea that death is not the last thing, but rather a phase of a sickness, is explored, and it is suggested that true despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die, which is a state of being trapped in a desperate situation.
- The view that despair is a necessary step towards spiritual growth and self-awareness is presented, and it is argued that this perspective is not gloomy or depressing, but rather uplifting, as it views every person as being capable of becoming spirit and being conscious of themselves as self.
- The importance of becoming eternally and decisively conscious of oneself as spirit is emphasized, and it is stated that a person's life is wasted if they never become aware of their [[Existence | existence]] before [[God]], which can only be attained through despair, as noted in the discussion of wasted lives.

## Delusion, Despair, and Spiritual Awareness
- The tendency for people to erect grand systems and theories, but fail to live according to them, is criticized, and it is noted that this can be a form of delusion, where individuals prioritize completing their systems over personal authenticity, as illustrated by the example of a thinker who builds an immense system but lives in a state of personal contradiction.
- The idea that one must first despair completely in order to break through to a deeper level of spiritual awareness is presented, and it is suggested that this process can be a transformative experience, as noted in the phrase "one would first have to despair completely, to despair out and out, and then the spirit-life might break through from the very bottom".
- The ability of people to live in a state of despair while still functioning in the temporal world is discussed, and it is noted that this can be a hidden and unnoticeable phenomenon, where individuals may appear to be living normal lives but lack a true sense of self, as described in the passage "he may nevertheless be perfectly well able to live on, to be a man, as it seems, to occupy himself with temporal things".

## Spirituality, Despair, and the True Self
- The text discusses the concept of spirituality and the self, citing Vivekananda's statement that individuals who die without realizing their true Self as Spirit die like animals, and highlighting the idea that people who are not conscious of themselves as spirit or before [[God]] are in a state of despair, regardless of their accomplishments or enjoyment of life.
- According to the text, individuals who are not grounded in God and do not understand the source of their faculties may experience despair, but they often misidentify the cause of their despair, focusing on earthly losses rather than the loss of the eternal, and may claim to be in despair without truly understanding what it means.
- The text also explores the idea that people may go through life without developing a true self, instead imitating others and living a superficial [[Existence | existence]], and that even in the face of adversity, they may not develop a deeper understanding of themselves or their place in the world, as evidenced by the example of someone who claims to be a [[Christianity | Christian]] but does not truly become a self.
- Additionally, the text touches on the idea that individuals may feel a need for solitude, which is a vital necessity for them, and that this need can be intense, like the need for breathing or sleeping, suggesting that people may be drawn to spiritual or introspective pursuits as a way to connect with their true selves.
- The text critiques the superficiality of modern life, where people may be distracted by worldly concerns and diversions, and may not truly understand or practice their faith, instead going through the motions of religion without developing a deeper sense of self or spirituality, as exemplified by the image of someone holding their head under water or going mad for God.

## The Importance of Solitude and the Self
- The text discusses the importance of solitude and the need for individuals to have time alone, as it is a sign of a deeper nature and a measure of one's spirit, with those who are unable to be alone being compared to social birds that die without the presence of others.
- In contrast to ancient times and the Middle Ages, where solitude was respected, modern society shuns solitude and views it as a punishment, which is seen as a reflection of the fact that having spirit is considered a crime in today's age.
- The text also explores the concept of the self and how it can create illusions of virtue and self-control, but ultimately, these constructions are empty and lack substance, highlighting the complexity of human nature and the search for meaning.
- The author discusses the definition of faith as being grounded transparently in [[God]], and how this understanding of faith is central to the text, with faith being seen as the opposite of sin, rather than virtue, and morality being viewed as illusory and not concerned with actions.
- The text references the idea that sin is not the opposite of virtue, but rather a state of consciousness characterized by [[Nihilism | nihilism]] and the awareness of death, and that faith is the experience of living with this awareness, citing philosophers such as Tillich and concepts like Maya.
- The author also addresses criticisms of [[Christianity]], suggesting that people are offended by its teachings not because they are too dark or severe, but because they are too high and demanding, requiring individuals to strive for something extraordinary and to live in intimate relationship with God, as referenced by authors like Tolstoy and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- Ultimately, the text presents a vision of Christianity that is both challenging and profound, one that requires individuals to have the humble courage to believe in the extraordinary offer of help and relationship that God extends to humanity, and to dare to accept this offer, as emphasized by the author's discussion of faith and sin.

## Christianity, Sin, and the Natural Man
- The natural man is often unable to comprehend or accept the extraordinary concepts of Christianity, such as the concept of sin, and therefore may be offended by them, as they cannot fit these ideas into their narrow-minded and comfortable worldview.
- According to the text, Christianity takes a significant step beyond the ordinary and into the absurd, which can lead to offense, and it is the concept of sin that distinguishes Christianity from paganism, with the natural man lacking the understanding of sin due to a lack of defiant will.
- The text also critiques individuals who claim to understand and appreciate noble concepts, such as self-denial and sacrificing one's life for the truth, but then proceed to act in contradiction to these values, demonstrating a lack of genuine understanding and a tendency to prioritize worldly gain and recognition.
- The figure of [[Socrates]] is referenced throughout the text, with the author suggesting that the world needs a Socratic approach, which emphasizes ethical and religious understanding, rather than just aesthetic and metaphysical knowledge, and that many people labor to obscure their genuine understanding of what is right in order to avoid making difficult decisions.
- The author argues that true understanding of what is right is essential, and that without it, individuals may claim to have knowledge, but ultimately, they are just distracting themselves from the ethical and religious implications of their actions, and that a Socratic approach is necessary to cut through the confusion and distractions of the world.

## Socratic Ignorance and the State of Christendom
- The Greek spirit lacked the courage to acknowledge that a person can knowingly do wrong, and Socrates intervened by stating that when a person does wrong, they have not understood what is right, as expressed in the quote "When a man does wrong, he has not understood what is right."
- The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of human comprehension, particularly in relation to [[Christianity]], and asserts that it is a plain ethical duty to admit that one cannot fully comprehend it, which is a concept that the age and Christendom need, referred to as Socratic ignorance.
- The author highlights that Socratic ignorance is not just a lack of knowledge, but a kind of godly fear and divine worship, as Socrates' ignorance was rooted in reverence for the Deity and a recognition of the qualitative distinction between [[God]] and man.
- The author criticizes the state of Christendom, stating that it has become a wretched edition of Christianity, full of misprints and senseless omissions, and that it has taken Christianity's name in vain, with many people claiming to be Christians without truly understanding or living according to its principles.
- The author also discusses the rarity of true priests and the importance of continuity with respect to one's consciousness of oneself, noting that many people are only momentarily conscious and lack a deep understanding of themselves and their spirituality.

## The Christian Concept of Sin and Self-Awareness
- The author explores the concept of sin in a [[Christianity | Christian]] context, stating that sin is a position that develops a more and more positive continuity, and that it is a paradox that no person can fully comprehend, requiring instead a deep sense of experience and faith, as expressed in the quote "Christianly sin is (and this has to be believed, it is indeed the paradox which no man can comprehend) -- sin is a position which out of itself develops a more and more positive ponerende continuity."
- The author references the idea that to sin is human, but to remain in sin is devilish, and suggests that this proverb must be understood in a different sense from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the gravity of sin and the need for repentance and faith.
- The concept of sin is often misunderstood as merely a series of individual acts, rather than a continuous state of being, with the particular sins being expressions of this ongoing state, similar to how the puffing of a locomotive is a visible manifestation of its underlying momentum.
- Most people live without a deep understanding of themselves and their own consistency, [[Existence | existing]] in a state of spiritual unawareness, where their lives are marked by a series of disconnected events and actions, without a sense of infinite self-consistency.
- The state of being in sin is what holds the individual together, giving them a sense of self and consistency, with particular new sins being merely expressions of this underlying state, rather than the cause of their sinfulness.

## The Selfish Despairer and the Rejection of Forgiveness
- The selfish and ambitious nature of the individual is a key aspect of their sinfulness, with their despair and refusal to accept forgiveness being a form of rebellion against [[God]].
- The concept of God is often used carelessly and without true understanding, with many people paying lip service to their faith without genuinely grappling with its implications, and the despairer's rejection of God's forgiveness is a manifestation of their desire to be themselves, even if that means embracing their own torment and protesting against the existence of a higher power.
- The despairer's mindset is characterized by a desire to be themselves, even in their suffering, and to assert their individuality against the world, with their torment becoming a form of self-definition and a way to protest against the [[Existence | existence]] of a higher power.

## The Despair of Weakness and the Comfort of Eternity
- The text discusses the concept of despair, particularly the despair of weakness, which is a passive suffering of the self, and how it differs from the despair of self-assertion, with the author noting that the weak despairer will not hear about the comfort of eternity because it would be the destruction of them as an objection against the whole of existence.
- The author explains that the despairer who is depicted in the text does not realize that they are in despair over the eternal, but rather thinks they are in despair over something earthly, and that this is because they ascribe great value to earthly things, which is precisely to despair about the eternal.
- The text also touches on the idea that most people have not become very deep in despair, and that they live in the category of immediacy, with only a few attempting to live in the category of spirit, and that those who do attempt to take the inward direction often veer away when they encounter the first difficulties.
- The author notes that despair over the earthly or something earthly is the most common sort of despair, especially in the second form of immediacy with a quantitative reflection, and that this is why many people believe that despair is something that only belongs to youth, but the author argues that this is not the case.
- The text highlights the importance of self-reflection and ethical reflection in overcoming despair, and that the self must be dissociated from external circumstances in order to truly understand and accept oneself, with the author suggesting that this requires a breach with immediacy as a whole and a consciousness of a self that is gained by the infinite abstraction from everything outward.
- The author mentions that there are very few people who live even passably in the category of spirit, and that most people shy away from this life, having not learned to fear and not understanding what "must" means, and that they are therefore unable to endure the contradictions and challenges that come with living a life of spirit.

## Despair, Childish Illusion, and the Path to Faith
- The text discusses the concept of despair and how it affects individuals, with Tolstoy mentioning that his initial thoughts on existential concerns are often referred to as "childish" and that many people retain a sense of childish illusion throughout their lives.
- According to the text, a person who despairs understands that it is a weakness to take earthly concerns too seriously, but instead of turning to faith, they become more deeply absorbed in despair and despairs over their own weakness, leading to a deeper consciousness of their despair.
- The text also notes that such despair is relatively rare, and if it does not lead to a radical change towards faith, it can either intensify into a higher form of introversion or break through to the outside, causing the individual to plunge into life and distractions, as mentioned by [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]].
- If an individual maintains absolute introversion, they are at risk of suicide, but if they open up to someone, they may be less likely to consider suicide, although they may still fall into despair due to the fact that they have shared their secret with another person.
- The text highlights the idea that the despairing individual who is conscious of their despair is further from salvation than one who is unconscious of it, and that the conscious despairer's despair is more intense, as noted by Kierkegaard, who also mentions that he has no "common language" with others.
- Additionally, the text references the idea that participation and simple salvation, as discussed by Tolstoy and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], are not easily attainable, and that the despairing individual may mistakenly believe that transformation can be accomplished easily, like changing a coat.
- The concept of unawareness is discussed as a form of despair that can be particularly dangerous, as it may lead individuals to desperately seek permission to despair, and they may even resist any attempts to prevent them from doing so, as noted in the context of the poet's perspective.

## Unawareness as Despair and the Question of Eternity
- A specific form of despair is described as being unnoticed in the world, where individuals lose their sense of self and become perfectly adjusted to the world, making them successful in a worldly sense, but this form of despair is not recognized as such, and is instead seen as a desirable state, with the world having no understanding of what is truly dreadful, as also alluded to in the context of Heidegger's idea of living 'concretely'.
- The text also explores the idea that when an individual's time on earth comes to an end, eternity will ask only one question: whether they lived in despair or not, regardless of their circumstances, status, or accomplishments, and this question will reveal the true state of their soul, with the individual's response to despair being the determining factor.
- The importance of becoming eternally and decisively conscious of oneself as spirit, as self, is emphasized, and it is noted that this can only be achieved through despair, with the individual's life being considered wasted if they never became aware of their [[Existence | existence]] before [[God]], and the possibility of gaining infinity through despair is highlighted.
- The believer is said to possess the antidote to despair, which is the possibility that comes with faith, as with God all things are possible, and this faith resolves contradictions, such as the human certainty of destruction and the possibility of salvation, allowing the individual to find health and resolution in their spiritual life, much like a healthy body resolves physical contradictions, as noted in the comparison to a draft being indifferently cold and warm.

## Faith, Anxiety, and the Human Condition
- The concept of faith is complex, with philosophers like Tillich and [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] acknowledging the role of doubt in faith, and Kierkegaard himself struggling to make the "leap" of faith, which raises questions about the actualization of this type of faith.
- According to the text, humans are designed to be spiritual, but many people prefer to dwell in the "cellar" of sensuousness, becoming furious when encouraged to occupy the higher level of their being, which is available to them but remains unoccupied.
- The state of despair is often characterized by a half-obscurity, where the individual is partially aware of their condition but refuses to fully acknowledge it, and may use diversions or distractions to maintain this obscurity, sometimes even doing so with a certain level of self-awareness and psychological insight.
- When individuals fail to confront their inner selves, they may turn away from the inward direction and focus on outward appearances, accepting their given abilities and talents, but neglecting true self-reflection and potentially forgetting their deeper selves in the process.
- This neglect of the inner self can lead to a life of outward success and respectability, where the individual becomes a respected member of society, but may still be lacking in true self-awareness and spiritual depth, as exemplified by the example of a person who is a [[Christianity | Christian]] in Christendom, but only in a superficial sense, similar to how they would have conformed to the dominant culture in any other society.

## Immortality, Purity of Heart, and the Eternal
- The question of immortality is a recurring theme, with the individual wondering if there is an afterlife where one would recognize themselves again, which is particularly interesting for someone who is questioning their own sense of self.
- The concept of purity of heart is to will one thing, and this is only achievable by focusing on the Eternal, which is always present and true, whereas the changeable is subject to change and can lead to folly.
- A person who seeks relief from suffering through temporal [[Existence | existence]] is actually forgetting the Eternal, and a man of prayer does not need to seek knowledge from learned books, but rather remains piously ignorant of worldly things and focuses on the Good.
- The worldly goal is not one thing, but rather an illusion that appears to be one thing, and it is actually a multitude of things that can change into its opposite, whereas the Good is one thing in its essence and remains the same in all its expressions.
- Worldly honor is a whirlpool of confused forces and a sense-deception, and even if it were unanimous, it would still be meaningless, as it requires one to grovel, flatter, and betray others, and ultimately leads to despising oneself and trembling before change.

## Nihilism, Double-Mindedness, and the Temporal
- The experience of [[Nihilism | nihilism]] is described as the change of death, where the sensual man must step aside and all becomes soberly quiet, and the text also suggests that despair is simply double-mindedness, implying that it is a state of being torn between two conflicting desires or beliefs.
- The concept of despair is described as having two wills, where an individual fruitlessly tries to follow one will while avoiding another, resulting in a state of double-mindedness, as noted by James as the 'divided self'.
- The human experience is marked by a disconnect between the ideal life and the actual life, where individuals have great moments of hope and enthusiasm, but these are often forgotten in the daily routine, and their words of enthusiasm are not backed by actions, as referenced in James 3:5.
- People have intentions and plans for life, but these often lose their strength and fade away, unable to withstand opposition, and this is evident in the way individuals quickly forget their resolutions and fail to make lasting changes.
- The text also describes the consequences of over-screeching one's nature and conscience, leading to a state of dryness and emptiness, where individuals become giddy and lose sight of what is truly important, and this can ultimately lead to destruction.
- It is noted that it is horrible to see individuals rush towards their own destruction, and even more horrible when they are aware of their situation but choose to quietly witness their own downfall, rather than seeking help, and this is seen as a form of extreme vanity.
- The speaker acknowledges their own share of double-mindedness and frailties, and expresses a desire for the talk to attract listeners to the Good, rather than to the speaker themselves, and to repel them from judging others, as this would also be a form of double-mindedness, and instead, the focus should be on selflessness.
- The text concludes by questioning the nature of the world, citing [[Religious text | Scripture]], such as I [[John the Apostle | John]] 5:19, which states that the world "lieth in wickedness", and suggesting that if the world is not inherently Good, then earthly reward is of a doubtful character, and this raises important questions about the human condition and the nature of morality.

## Willing the Good, Suffering, and the Eternal
- The text discusses the concept of willing the Good, emphasizing that true willingness to do good should not be motivated by the desire for reward or the fear of punishment, as this constitutes double-mindedness, a concept also explored in [[Karma yoga | Karma Yoga]].
- According to the text, the world often rewards what resembles the Good, but true willingness to do good should not be influenced by this, and individuals should guard themselves against the temptation of reward, even if it comes from [[God]], to rightly will the Good.
- The text also highlights that doing good is often met with ingratitude, lack of appreciation, poverty, contempt, and suffering, and that true faith and hope are related to the Eternal through the will, with the wish being the sufferer's connection to a happier temporal [[Existence | existence]].
- The concept of the wish is further explored, with the text stating that it is not the cure for suffering, but rather the life in suffering, the health in suffering, and the perseverance in suffering, keeping the wound of suffering open for the Eternal to heal, a concept also discussed by thinkers such as [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], Zapffe, Becker, Tillich, and Ligotti.
- The text contrasts the wish with hope, stating that while there are short-lived and childish hopes, there is also a hope that is born in death and does not die, committing the sufferer to the Good, and that faith can also be a source of commitment to the Good, with true faith seizing the Eternal and holding fast to it, even in the face of suffering and death.
- The text ultimately presents a nuanced and complex exploration of the human experience, highlighting the importance of faith, hope, and the willingness to do good, even in the face of adversity, and referencing various philosophical and spiritual concepts, including those discussed by Karma Yoga, Vivekananda, Zapffe, Becker, Tillich, and Ligotti.

## Faith, Love, and Suffering
- The text discusses the concept of faith and love in relation to suffering, emphasizing that with love, a sufferer can draw the Eternal nearer to themselves and experience a love that endures beyond death, committing them to the Good.
- The author warns against despair, stating that it is to deny that [[God]] is love, and instead encourages the sufferer to commit themselves to the Good by hope, faith, and love, rather than seeking temporary relief or comfort from the world.
- The text also explores the idea of the wish, which is the desire to be with the Infinite, and how it can be strengthened or abandoned in the face of suffering, with the author urging the sufferer to take a single, decisive step towards the Eternal, regardless of their circumstances.
- The author emphasizes the importance of not turning away from the sight of suffering too soon, but rather dwelling on it and sharing in the common lot of suffering as a fellow human being, in order to find healing and comfort.
- The text highlights the distinction between useless suffering and suffering that helps one reach the highest, stating that suffering is only useless when one will not let themselves be helped by it, and that it can be a medicine for the "deadly disease of busyness" when pondered and shared with others.
- The author encourages self-reflection and strictness with oneself, in order to truly understand and empathize with those who are suffering, and to avoid calling oneself a sufferer without truly experiencing the depth of suffering.

## Suffering, Edification, and the Human Experience
- The text discusses the concept of suffering and how it can be a deeply personal and isolating experience, with some pains being impossible to fully understand or sympathize with, and it is noted that this type of suffering is not related to earthly concerns such as [[Job (biblical figure) | job]] or relationships, but rather to existential concerns like the concept of [[God]], Nothingness, or [[Nihilism]].
- The text uses the metaphor of a lone horse that joins a meeting of other horses to learn about life, where the elder horses share their wisdom about the suffering and hardships that horses face, and this story serves as a way to illustrate the universal experience of suffering.
- The text also references biblical concepts, such as the idea that one sinner who repents is more important to Heaven than ninety-nine righteous men who have no need of repentance, as mentioned in [[Gospel of Luke | Luke]] 15:7, and the phrase "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened" from [[Gospel of Matthew | Matthew]] 11:28, to emphasize the importance of acknowledging and addressing the deeper, more profound sufferings in life.
- The concept of edification is introduced as a common human concern that involves contemplating and understanding the sufferings of others, and it is noted that this type of contemplation is more important than the actions of those who are busy but do not truly suffer, and that true edification requires a willingness to confront and discuss the more terrible sufferings in life.
- The text critiques those who avoid discussing or thinking about the more profound sufferings in life, preferring instead to focus on more superficial concerns, and argues that this type of avoidance is a form of escapism that can lead to a lack of frankness and a bad conscience, and that true edification requires a willingness to confront and understand the deeper sufferings of others.

## Suffering, Authenticity, and the Edifying Talk
- The author reflects on the concept of suffering and how it relates to authenticity and the human experience, drawing parallels between the idea of "bad conscience" and Jean-[[Paul the Apostle | Paul]] Sartre's concept of "bad faith", which both seem to be about authenticity and double-mindedness.
- The text quotes a passage that suggests that while others may offer comfort and aid to those who are suffering, the sufferer must ultimately help themselves and be willing to suffer all in order to be committed to the Good, with the author noting that this commitment is not about being exempt from suffering, but rather about being intimately bound to [[God]].
- The author addresses the reader directly, acknowledging that talk of suffering can be tiresome, but emphasizing that an edifying talk never tires of it, and that even those who are considered "happy" can benefit from knowledge of suffering in order to improve their education and character.
- The text encourages sufferers not to let their lives be consumed by futile counting of their sufferings, but rather to remember that they can still accomplish something, even if it is just willing to suffer all and being committed to the Good, with the author distinguishing between true sufferers and those who feign suffering for attention.
- The author emphasizes the importance of commitment and loyalty to the Good, even in the face of suffering, and warns against the destructive power of cleverness, which can be misused to evade decisions and postpone commitment, noting that true healing and salvation come from the Eternal, not from earthly or temporal solutions.
- The author concludes by emphasizing the need for sufferers to remain firm in their commitment to the Good, even when faced with the temptation to use cleverness to escape or avoid their suffering, and to trust in the Eternal for healing and salvation, rather than relying on earthly means.

## Suffering, Cleverness, and the Eternal's Healing
- The text discusses the concept of suffering and the role of the Eternal in healing, highlighting that the Eternal's healing is not a physical cure, but rather a spiritual one, and that those who cling to earthly hopes and cleverness may miss out on the Eternal's help.
- According to the text, when a sufferer dedicates themselves to their suffering and renounces earthly hopes, they may initially experience a sense of hopelessness, but ultimately, they can find rest in the trustworthiness of the Eternal, as seen in the example of a sick man finding relief in a particular position.
- The text also explores the idea of double-mindedness, where a sufferer wishes to be healed but does not truly desire to be healed by the Eternal, leading to a state of internal disease and increasing restlessness, as exemplified by the double-minded person who, even at the moment of death, is afraid to make a decision and send for a clergyman, due to cleverness and fear of the unknown.
- The author references the philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] and the concept of Pascal's Wager, suggesting that taking one's suffering to heart and seeking comfort in the Eternal can be a source of solace, even if it seems like a gamble, and that cleverness and earthly hopes can ultimately lead to despair and a lack of true healing.
- The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of taking one's suffering to heart and seeking help from the Eternal, rather than relying on cleverness and earthly hopes, which can hinder the decision to seek true healing and lead to a state of double-mindedness and internal disease.

## Temporal Hopes vs. Eternal Commitment
- The text discusses the idea that individuals often prefer to hold onto temporal hopes and expectations rather than committing to the Eternal, due to a fear of regretting their decision, even though the Eternal is the only thing that can bring true consolation without regret.
- It criticizes the use of cleverness to evade commitment to the Eternal, stating that this double-mindedness is rooted in an unwillingness to let go of worldly things and can lead to a shallow and mediocre form of consolation that ultimately ends in remorse.
- The text argues that true comfort and salvation can only be found in commitment to the Eternal, and that offering or seeking temporal comfort is like giving a pauper counterfeit coin when one has gold to offer, emphasizing that the Eternal's comfort is pure gold.
- It highlights the difference between the sufferer who receives the Eternal's victorious comfort and [[God | the one]] who seeks temporary distractions or deceitful evasions, stating that the true sufferer must answer for the manner in which they have used their time and whether they have allowed themselves to be eternally healed.
- The text also critiques the notion that one should never give up hope, stating that there are certain hopes and desires that should be put to death, and that the Eternal calls out the hypocrisy of speaking equivocally about hope, emphasizing the need for genuine commitment to the Eternal.

## Commitment to the Good and the Sufferer's Path
- The concept of earthly hope needs to be relinquished, as it can hinder the attainment of true hope, and the sufferer should not accept deliverance on the world's terms, as stated in Hebrews 11:15, but instead, should focus on the commitment to the Good.
- The sufferer who sincerely wills the Good uses cleverness to cut off evasions and launch themselves into the commitment, escaping the disillusionments of choosing the temporal way, and this commitment is not about concentrating sufferings, but about breaking through to the Eternal.
- The sufferer should not take upon themselves the suffering of a whole lifetime in advance, but instead, should take each day's burden as it comes, and the commitment should not be understood as a means to win something eternal through advance acceptance of suffering, but rather as a means to remain committed to the Good.
- The active one and the sufferer may both be committed to the Good, but they work in different directions, with the active one working from without to conquer, and the sufferer working inwardly by being willing to suffer all, and the true sufferer can always work for the Good outwardly by the power of example.
- The life of the sufferer, when committed to the Good, contains a great challenge to others and a severe judgment upon those who use their gifts inexcusably, and even if the sufferer is cut off from others, they are still sharing in mankind's great common concern and defending a difficult pass by saving their own soul.

## Suffering, Courage, and Patience
- The question of whether one can will suffering is discussed, and it is distinguished between willing in the sense of inclination and willing in the noble sense of freedom, with the understanding that for many, it is impossible to unite freedom and suffering in the same thought, and philosophers like [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]] have also discussed similar ideas.
- The passage discusses how people often view those who choose to suffer or take the harder path in life as fanatics or lunatics, citing the example of a person of means who could easily live a life of comfort but instead chooses to strain themselves and take on burdensome tasks.
- According to the text, courage is the willingness to voluntarily accept suffering, as illustrated by the example of a courageous knight who spurs his horse forward against a terrifying object, with the knight representing courage and the horse representing the lowly and skittish aspects of human nature.
- The concept of patience is also explored, with the Danish word for "patience" (Taalmod) containing the word for "courage" (Mod), and patience being described as the courage to voluntarily accept unavoidable suffering, with the sufferer finding freedom in the midst of suffering through submission to it.
- The passage also touches on the idea that people often view those who bear unavoidable suffering patiently as being coerced or making a virtue out of necessity, but the text argues that this is indeed a virtue, as the sufferer is bringing a determination of freedom out of necessity.
- The author references the philosopher Tillich, and discusses how the true sufferer's condition can be a catalyst for learning what the highest is, with the healing power of the decision for the Eternal residing in the sufferer's ability to voluntarily accept compulsory suffering.
- Ultimately, the passage suggests that patience can perform an even greater miracle than courage, as it achieves freedom in unavoidable suffering, and that the sufferer can find a sense of freedom and determination through their patient endurance of suffering.

## Suffering, Cleverness, and the Triumph of the Good
- The concept of suffering is discussed in relation to the use of cleverness, where a Good person utilizes their cleverness to avoid escaping from suffering and instead remains committed to the Good by accepting the necessity of suffering.
- According to the text, a truly Good person does not will the Good for the sake of reward or to avoid punishment, but rather wills that the Good shall triumph through them, and they desire to be an instrument of the Good without seeking recognition or reward from the world or men.
- The text also warns against confusing impatience with humble, obedient enthusiasm, as impatience can lead to double-mindedness, which is distinct from true inspiration, and a double-minded person is not easily recognizable on earth as they do not will the Good for the sake of reward or punishment.
- The idea of time and eternity is explored, with the question of why time exists if the Good has always been victorious, and why individuals who sincerely will the Good are scattered and separated, making it difficult for them to connect with one another.
- The text references various philosophers and thinkers, including [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], and Huxley, and expresses a desire to combine different perspectives, including East and West, to gain a deeper understanding of the human experience.
- The concept of double-mindedness is further explored, with the suggestion that a double-minded person is not recognizable in the world because their double-mindedness is not evident, and it is only at the boundary between time and eternity that their true nature is revealed to the [[God | all-knowing]] One.
- The text ultimately suggests that true commitment to the Good requires selflessness and a willingness to sacrifice all, without seeking reward or recognition, and that this commitment is not easily recognizable in the world, but is instead recognized by a higher power.

## Blessed Assurance, Fleeting Desires, and the Fear of God
- The text discusses the importance of having a blessed assurance that the Good has always been victorious, which provides a sense of security and comfort that surpasses all understanding, and allows individuals to have pride and honor even in difficult times.
- It highlights the fleeting nature of momentary desires and passions, such as lust and anger, which may seem irresistible in the moment but become loathsome and vain in retrospect, and ultimately lead to repentance.
- The text also critiques the tendency for people to rush into crowds out of fear, and notes that true boldness lies in not being afraid, not even of [[God]], and that individuals who are truly afraid of God are often ridiculed by the crowd.
- The author emphasizes the importance of fearing God, not just loving Him, as a means of acknowledging one's eternal responsibility before God, and notes that this fear is essential for individuals who are conscious of being individuals and are aware of their accountability to God.
- The text encourages individuals to live in a way that allows them to cultivate a sense of consciousness and responsibility, which will enable them to navigate the relationships and duties of life with clarity and purpose, without withdrawing from the world or becoming overly self-absorbed.
- The author suggests that being mindful of one's eternal responsibility will help individuals to prioritize their actions and focus on what is truly important, and to avoid wasting time on frivolous activities, and instead to work selflessly and with a focus on the Good.
- The text concludes by referencing the biblical quote "it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting," which highlights the importance of remembering that all earthly things are fleeting and will be forgotten, and that true wisdom and understanding can be gained through reflection and contemplation.

## The Eternal, Busyness, and the Importance of Reflection
- The concept of the Eternal is not forgotten, even after a thousand years, and it demands purity of heart and willing one thing, but in daily life, this claim is often set aside and ignored in the midst of busyness and worldly pursuits.
- In the world, people are often more concerned with influence, power, and wealth than with willing the Good, and they do not consider it important to scrutinize whether someone wholly wills the Good as long as they are successful and have a good reputation.
- The rush of life and the pressure of busyness can lead people to neglect contemplation and distinct thoughts, and instead, they may be deceived into thinking they have had an experience of contemplation when they have not.
- The author argues that this busyness is like a charm that can be harmful, especially to children and young people, who need quiet and retirement to allow the Eternal to unfold a divine growth.
- The author also discusses [[The Concept of Anxiety | the concept of anxiety]] and how it can be a danger to those who are educated by possibility, as it can lead to a fall, such as suicide, if not understood and addressed properly, and that whoever is educated by possibility remains with anxiety and does not permit themselves to be deceived by its falsifications.
- The author emphasizes the importance of taking time to pause and reflect on one's life and willing the Good, and not just delegating this task to someone else, as every person should do this for themselves, and that this higher claim should command a person's whole mind, industry, and strength.

## Anxiety, Freedom, and the School of Possibility
- The concept of anxiety is discussed as a transformative force that can lead individuals to freedom and possibility, with the understanding that anxiety is a school that educates through the absurd perspective, where all actions are equally valid, akin to [[Nihilism | nihilism]].
- According to the text, anxiety is freedom's possibility, and it is through faith that anxiety becomes absolutely formative, consuming all finite ends and discovering their deceptions, with no respite or distraction from its torments, as noted in the quote that no Grand Inquisitor has such frightful torments in readiness as has anxiety.
- The individual formed by anxiety is shaped by possibility and is cultivated according to their infinitude, with the understanding that possibility is the most difficult of all categories, as it encompasses all things being equally possible, including both the terrifying and the smiling.
- The text critiques the common perception that possibility is light, suggesting that this view is often held by those who do not truly understand possibility and instead cling to a mendacious invention of human depravity, whereas true possibility includes the potential for horror, perdition, and annihilation, as well as happiness and good fortune.
- The author argues that only when an individual has grasped the true nature of possibility, including its terrifying aspects, can they graduate from the school of possibility and develop a new appreciation for actuality, praising it as lighter than the weight of possibility, as noted in the phrase that actuality is far, far lighter than possibility had been.
- The text suggests that this process of formation through possibility requires honesty and faith, with faith understood as the inner certainty that anticipates infinity, as characterized by Hegel, and that through this faith, the individual can overcome the overwhelming anxiety of possibility and idealize finitudes in the shape of infinity.
- The author acknowledges that this perspective may seem obscure or foolish to those who have never experienced anxiety, but emphasizes the importance of embracing possibility and its transformative power in shaping the individual.

## Anxiety, Faith, and the Infinite
- The text discusses [[The Concept of Anxiety | the concept of anxiety]] and its relationship to faith, individuality, and the infinite, with references to philosophers such as [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] and similarities to the ideas of [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], highlighting that one should not be anxious about finite things, but rather about the possibilities of life.
- According to the text, a person who has never experienced anxiety is considered spiritless, and that anxiety is a necessary step towards faith, as it allows individuals to confront the nothingness of the world and turn inward, away from the finite and towards the infinite.
- The text also explores the idea that individuals who are formed by finitude, or the finite, will never arrive at true faith, and that faith requires a deeper understanding of guilt and anxiety, which can only be achieved by struggling with the infinite, as stated by Kierkegaard, and later echoed by Heidegger.
- Furthermore, the text notes that those who learn to know their guilt only through finite means, such as external judgments, will never truly understand their guilt, and that true guilt is infinite, requiring a deeper level of self-awareness and understanding.
- The text also touches on the idea that individuals can avoid spiritual trial and anxiety by becoming spiritless, and that this can be achieved by seeking the advice of others and conforming to societal norms, but that this approach will ultimately lead to a lack of true individuality and faith.
- Ultimately, the text suggests that true individuality and faith can only be achieved by embracing anxiety and the infinite, and that this requires a willingness to confront the nothingness of the world and to struggle with the complexities of human [[Existence | existence]], as discussed by philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Heidegger, and spiritual leaders like Vivekananda.

## Spiritual Trial, Repentance, and the Demonic
- The concept of spiritual trial is discussed, with some considering it a mere poetical fiction, while others believe it is a real and perilous journey, as described by philosophers such as Tillich and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], who suggest that life is a single, entire spiritual trail with no escape from the nothingness of the world.
- The idea of repentance is also explored, with faith being the only thing that can truly disarm the sophism of repentance, allowing individuals to renounce anxiety and extricate themselves from its grasp, as noted in the context of participation and the infinite and finite.
- The bondage of sin is described as a state where the individual is divided, with the "beast" taking on human form and constantly jeering at the person, much like a game where two people are concealed under one cloak, highlighting the concept of the divided self.
- The demonic is discussed as a fate that can happen to anyone, and it is only when it is touched by the good that it becomes clearly visible, with sympathy often being a way of protecting one's own egotism rather than truly helping the sufferer, as observed in the cowardly age where people distract themselves from lonely thoughts.
- The text also critiques the way people often ignore or downplay the demonic, treating it as a spook that can be ignored, and instead focus on cringing conflicts between individuals, highlighting the lack of inwardness in many people, including those who consider themselves holy, as noted in the examples of Tolstoy and Singer.
- The importance of inwardness is emphasized, with those who lack it being comical, even if they consider themselves holy, as they are often in an unfree relation to their holiness, and the world is justified in laughing at them, much like a bowlegged man trying to act as a dancing master, as described in the context of Ha, Participation, Tillich, and Vivekananda.

## Inwardness, Earnestness, and the Eternal
- The concept of the "holy" is discussed, where it is stated that the religious is absolutely commensurable and can be present at all times, emphasizing the importance of inwardness and earnestness in one's faith, as noted by the author of the Journal314_Quotes_FInal document.
- The text critiques both rigid [[Orthodoxy (book) | orthodoxy]] and freethinking for missing the point of true inwardness, using examples such as YouTube debates on the [[Existence | existence]] of [[God]], where both sides are too worldly and lack earnestness, and referencing the preacher in [[Ecclesiastes]] who says "all is vanity" to highlight the importance of earnestness.
- The author argues that whoever lives in daily communion with the thought of God could hardly wish to pervert this thought, and that earnestness is a matter that cannot be defined, but rather is something that one must truly know and understand, as emphasized by the author's statement that "what I say here proves much better than any conceptual development that I know in all earnestness what is being discussed".
- The text also discusses the object of earnestness, which is oneself, and states that one who has not become earnest about this object but about something else is a joker, and that irony is jealous of earnestness, as seen in the example of individuals who treat various things earnestly but have not become earnest about the object of earnestness.
- The author notes that when inwardness is lacking, the spirit is finitized, and that inwardness is therefore eternity or the constituent of the eternal in the human being, referencing Otto's concept of the "numinous" and the importance of the Nihilistic experience in understanding the eternal.
- The eternal is discussed as being often accepted and rejected in the present time, but that both acceptance and rejection show a lack of inwardness and earnestness, as seen in today's debates between the "religious" and atheists, where both sides lack inwardness and misunderstand the concept of eternity, such as the "moral argument".
- The text concludes by stating that people are in a hurry because of anxiety about the eternal, which makes the moment an abstraction, and that the denial of the eternal can express itself in various ways, such as mockery, prosaic intoxication with common sense, busyness, or enthusiasm for the temporal, and that eternity can be metaphysically construed in a way that preserves the temporal in a comical manner, as noted by the author in the context of the Journal314_Quotes_FInal document.

## The Comical, the Temporal, and Eternity
- The concept of the comical is rooted in the temporal, where contradictions arise, and it is this contradiction that gives rise to the comical, which is not present in eternity where all contradictions are canceled.
- The temporal is characterized by its accidental circumstances and odd nooks and crannies, where the soul has not been essentially present, and therefore, these aspects of life vanish, except for those who have been essentially present in them, but even for them, it will hardly acquire comical significance.
- The comical belongs to the temporal, and one cannot stop it metaphysically and aesthetically, and prevent it from finally swallowing whole the temporal, which will happen to someone developed enough to use the comic but not mature enough to distinguish between the eternal and the temporal.
- Eternity is not what people think earnestly about, instead, they are anxious about it, and anxiety can lead to a hundred evasions, and it is through anxiety that freedom's possibility announces itself, and this anxiety is directed towards a nothing, rather than a something.
- The object of anxiety is a nothing, and if its object is something that signifies something in terms of freedom, then we do not have a leap but a quantitative transition, and this is a concept that is also discussed by philosophers such as Tillich and Heidegger, and possibly Buber.

## Anxiety, Freedom, and the Limits of Genius
- An individual's relation to its historical environment is complex, and freedom's possibility announces itself in anxiety, which can be triggered by various factors, including reminders, sights, jokes, speech, and silence, and these factors can have opposite effects on different individuals, highlighting the infinite limit of the quantitative.
- The concept of genius is also discussed, and it is noted that genius does not become significant in the most profound sense, as its compass can extend no further than that of fate in relation to fortune, misfortune, esteem, honor, power, immortal fame, all of which are temporal terms, and a deeper dialectical characterization of anxiety is excluded, and instead, anxiety is directed towards the appearance of guilt, which is an attribute of honor.
- The state of being a genius can happen to anyone, but a true genius would deeply grasp the profoundest mysteries of human [[Existence | existence]] and strive to understand them, rather than just being concerned with humanity, and this understanding requires courage and a willingness to acknowledge the imperfections of their own existence.
- According to the text, the existence of a genius can be considered a sin, and one can only come to understand this by satisfying the hunger of the wishful soul, and even then, the genius's existence may not necessarily be happy, but rather a means of recreation that does not rise above the categories of temporality.
- The text suggests that only through religious reflection can genius and talent be justified in the deepest sense, and that a genius who turns towards themselves and the divine could become a religious genius, but would also have to endure great agonies, and that those who are insufficiently mature spiritually will not be able to grasp the true nature of immortality and spirit.
- Every human life is considered to be religiously arranged, and denying this would confuse everything and cancel out the concepts of individuality, race, and immortality, and the text criticizes the idea that people's talents and abilities should be used for mundane purposes, such as being a diplomat or an actor, without considering the deeper religious implications.
- The text laments that people do not take the time to reflect on how their religious existence relates to their outward existence, and instead get caught up in the fleeting moments of life, and that even those who attend church occasionally may not truly be living a religious existence, and that a profound religious reflection is required to truly understand how to live a meaningful life, even in tasks such as becoming a comic actor.

## The Religious Genius and the Path of Struggle
- The text raises the question of [[Repetition (Kierkegaard book) | repetition]], and how an individual can return to themselves whole, after having begun religious reflection, and whether they can succeed in doing so, and notes that in the Middle Ages, individuals would often annihilate their imperfect qualities in order to take hold of themselves, and that this is a difficult task that requires great spiritual maturity.
- The text discusses the concept of the religious genius, who, despite having outward gifts and talents, chooses to embark on a path of pain, distress, and anxiety to reflect on their religious beliefs, rather than following the broad and easy way that their talents might afford them.
- This struggle is exhausting and may lead to moments of regret and despair, but ultimately, the individual will hear a voice saying "Well done, my son, just keep on, for he who loses all, gains all," indicating that the sacrifice is worthwhile.
- The religious genius turns inward, towards themselves, and in doing so, discovers guilt, which is a fundamental aspect of their relationship with [[God]], and the greater the genius, the more profoundly they discover guilt.
- The text also touches on the idea that language is often used to conceal thoughts, and that true freedom is found in turning inward and discovering one's own guilt and sin-consciousness, rather than seeking external validation or success.

## Nihilism, the Death of God, and the Meaninglessness of a Mechanical World
- The philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is quoted, discussing the concept of the "hour of great contempt," in which even one's happiness, reason, and virtues become repulsive, and the individual is forced to re-evaluate their values and beliefs, leading to a kind of nihilistic experience and renunciation.
- Additionally, the text critiques the idea of a purely "scientific" interpretation of the world, suggesting that such an approach may be lacking in significance and meaning, and that mechanics, in particular, is not a sufficient foundation for understanding [[Existence | existence]], as noted in Nietzsche's work, "[[The Gay Science]]".
- The concept of a mechanical world is deemed to be essentially meaningless, as it would neglect the intrinsic value of aspects like music, which cannot be fully appreciated through mere calculation or formulation, as noted in the discussion on the nature of music and its value.
- The quotes from the text suggest that the appearance of pessimism and [[Nihilism | nihilism]] can be a sign of growth and transition into new conditions of existence, as stated by the author, and that experiencing nihilism is necessary to understand the true value of societal values and ideals.
- The idea of a "true world" is questioned, with the suggestion that all values and ideals are based on fictitious categories and are designed to maintain human constructs of domination, as the text explains, and that the most extreme form of nihilism would be the view that every belief is necessarily false due to the lack of a true world.
- The author discusses the relationship between morality and nihilism, noting that those who have abandoned [[God]] cling to faith in morality, and that purely moral value systems, such as [[Buddhism]], can end in nihilism, as the text states, and that this is expected in Europe, where people hope to maintain moralism without a religious background.
- The text also touches on the idea of self-narcotization and the emptiness that can result from not knowing one's direction or purpose, as well as the concept of "creatureliness" and the transvaluation of earthly values, as mentioned in the context of Otto's ideas and the experiences of the nihilist, and the author's emphasis on the importance of selflessness, as discussed in the context of [[Karma yoga | Karma Yoga]] and the ideas of [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].

## Nihilism, Morality, and the Search for Meaning
- The text from 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal' discusses various philosophical concepts, including the attempt to find meaning and purpose in life through intoxication, cruelty, and blind enthusiasm, as well as the pursuit of knowledge and art as a means to escape the bleakness of [[Existence | existence]].
- The philosophical nihilist is described as someone who believes that life is meaningless and in vain, but this perspective is challenged by the idea that pleasure and displeasure are only means to an end, and that the question of meaninglessness or its opposite may be insoluble for humans.
- The text also touches on the idea that morality has protected life against despair and the leap into nothing, and that the conception of a [[God | god]] [[Beyond Good and Evil | beyond good and evil]] is problematic, as it leaves us with the Absurd Perspective, where anything goes.
- The quote "man is something that is to be surpassed" suggests a naturalistic and earthly interpretation, rather than a complete renunciation of this world and submission to a higher power, and the famous phrase "we have killed him, you and I, we are all his murderers" refers to the death of God and the subsequent loss of direction and meaning.
- The text also includes critiques of [[Christianity]], with the statement "the Christian resolution to find the world ugly and bad, has made the world ugly and bad", and discusses the importance of individual action and responsibility, with the criterion for a proper mode of action being one that compromises only oneself.
- The text also references the ideas of Zarathustra, who speaks of deliverance from loathing and the need to find joyfulness, and includes quotes that suggest that suffering and impotence have created the concept of an afterlife, and that even those who despise the body are still serving their own self-interest.
- The final quote from 'The Gay Science' suggests that the author is more indebted to their long illness than to their health, implying that their experiences of suffering have been transformative and valuable.

## Pain, Depth, and the Limits of Language
- The author acknowledges that great pain has a profound impact on their life, leading to a higher level of health and a deeper understanding of themselves, as it forces them to re-examine their trust, good-nature, and gentleness, and to develop a greater sense of suspicion.
- The author expresses doubt that pain necessarily "improves" us, but rather believes that it deepens us, and notes that many people, including the most gifted and noble, often live their lives without questioning their beliefs or examining the reasons behind them.
- The author critiques the idea that language is a direct reflection of the cosmos, suggesting that language is only a starting point for wisdom, and that the language builder often overestimates the power of words to embody wisdom.
- The author argues that if the allegations of [[Christianity]], including the concept of an avenging [[God]] and eternal damnation, were true, then it would be irrational for people not to dedicate their lives to their salvation, and that the everyday Christian is a pitiable figure who is unable to think critically about their beliefs.
- The author views Christianity as a relic of antiquity, with assertions that are no longer believable in modern times, including the idea of a god who begets children by a mortal woman, a system of justice that accepts vicarious sacrifice, and the use of the cross as a symbol, all of which seem ghostly and outdated.

## Nihilism and the Decay of Traditional Values
- The text discusses the concept of [[Nihilism | nihilism]] and the decay of traditional values, with the author referencing Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas and quoting from his work, including "[[The Antichrist (book) | The Antichrist]]", to argue that the values humanity holds in high regard are actually decadence-values.
- The author contends that the highest values of humanity have been emptied of their true meaning and are now prevalent under the guise of holiest names, with concepts like "eternal salvation of the soul" being dependent on minute distinctions of concepts that have been refined by subtle disputes of sects.
- The author criticizes the tendency to destroy life by using rhetoric that conceals the true intention behind words like "the other world," "[[God]]," "the true life," "[[Nirvana]]," "salvation," and "blessedness", and instead argues that humanity has unlearned its previous beliefs and has become more modest in its understanding of the world.
- The text also touches on the idea that humanity has dropped its notion of being derived from the "spirit" or "god-head" and now regards itself as just another animal, with the author stating that man is the most botched and sickliest of all animals, but also the most interesting.
- The author further argues that consciousness or "the spirit" is not a sign of perfection, but rather a symptom of a relative imperfection of the organism, and that the concept of a "pure spirit" is a piece of pure stupidity, as it denies the importance of the nervous system and the senses.
- The author concludes by criticizing the concept of an imaginary teleology, such as the "kingdom of God" or "eternal life", which is seen as a fictitious world that falsifies and denies [[Existence | reality]], and is rooted in a hatred of the natural world and a profound uneasiness in the presence of reality.

## Reality, Suffering, and the Critique of Christianity
- The text discusses the concept of reality, suffering, and the role of religion in human life, with the author arguing that the preponderance of pains over pleasures leads to the creation of fictitious morality and religion, and that a person who suffers from reality must be a "botched reality".
- The author critiques the [[Christianity | Christian]] concept of a [[God | god]], describing it as a corrupt concept that declares war on life, nature, and the will to live, and instead praises the idea of a god that embodies both good and evil qualities, as a god who only represents goodness is not relatable or desirable.
- The author compares Christianity to [[Buddhism]], describing Buddhism as a more realistic and positive religion that faces problems objectively and coolly, and is based on a strict phenomenalism, with the concept of "god" already disposed of before its appearance.
- The author notes that Buddhism is focused on the struggle with suffering, rather than sin, and is [[Beyond Good and Evil | beyond good and evil]], and that it is based on two physiological facts: an excessive sensitiveness to sensation and an extraordinary spirituality, which can lead to depression and require hygienic measures to combat.
- The author describes the measures prescribed by [[The Buddha | Buddha]] to combat depression, including a life in the open, moderation in eating and drinking, caution in arousing passions, and the promotion of ideas that make for quiet contentment or good cheer, with the goal of promoting health and well-being, and notes that prayer and asceticism are not included in these measures.
- The author also mentions that [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]] would likely agree with their critique of the Christian concept of god, and that the author's own experiences and those of their readers, particularly the objectivists, are relevant to the discussion of the physiological states that underlie Buddhism.

## Morality, Religion, and the Human Condition
- The text discusses the concepts of morality, religion, and the human condition, citing the ideas of Buddha and the Jewish and [[Christianity | Christian]] faiths, and how they relate to the individual's sense of self and their place in the world.
- According to the text, Buddha's teaching emphasizes the importance of egoism as a duty, and combats mental fatigue by leading spiritual interests back to the individual's sense of self, while also advocating for a rejection of conflict and revenge.
- The text also quotes [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]], who suggests that when faith is exalted above reason and knowledge, it can lead to a discrediting of patient inquiry and a focus on hope as a stimulant to life, which can be more powerful than realized joy.
- The text criticizes the Jewish faith, stating that it involves a radical falsification of nature and [[Existence | reality]], and that it distorts concepts such as religion, civilization, morality, and history, turning them into contradictions of their natural significance.
- The text also discusses the concept of resentment and how it can lead to a rejection of life and the creation of a new world where acceptance of life is seen as evil, and how this can be used as a means to an end by those seeking power, such as the priestly class.
- Furthermore, the text argues that the concept of a [[God | god]] who demands obedience and punishment can lead to a perversion of morality, making it abstract and opposed to life, and that this can have negative consequences for individuals and society.
- The text ultimately seeks to understand what Jewish and [[Christianity | Christian]] morality entail, and how they relate to the human condition, with a critical perspective on the role of religion and faith in shaping individual and societal values.

## Morality, the Church, and the Misinterpretation of Christianity
- The text discusses the concept of morality and the influence of the church, stating that chance is robbed of its innocence and unhappiness is polluted with the idea of sin, while well-being is represented as a danger or temptation, and that philosophers support the church by perpetuating the lie of a "moral order of the world".
- The idea of a "moral order of the world" is criticized as a pitiable lie, where the priest takes the name of God in vain and determines the value of all things, calling the state of human society in which he has power "the kingdom of God", and the means of attaining this state "the will of God".
- The text also explores the concept of Christianity, stating that it actually denies the church, and that the [[Gospel | Gospels]] make instinctive the reverse of all heroic struggle, instead promoting the blessedness of peace, gentleness, and the inability to be an enemy, as seen in the sentence "resist not evil".
- The life and teachings of [[Jesus]] are discussed, with the author noting that Jesus claims nothing for himself alone, and that everyone is the child of [[God]] and equal to every other man, and that making Jesus a hero is a tremendous misunderstanding, as seen in the views of Tolstoy and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- The text also touches on the idea of the "spiritual" and the conception of civilization, stating that our whole conception of the "spiritual" could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in, and that a morbid sensibility of the tactile nerves can lead to a hatred of [[Existence | reality]] and a flight into the "intangible" and "incomprehensible".
- The author notes that the "Kingdom of God is within you", a phrase also attributed to Tolstoy and Vivekananda, and that this idea is related to an instinctive hatred of reality, which is a consequence of an extreme susceptibility to pain and irritation, and that this hatred of reality is a result of degeneration, as seen in the delayed and incomplete puberty in the living organism.
- The text concludes by highlighting the contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount, sea-shore, and fields, and the aggressive fanatic, and that the "glad tidings" tell us that there are no more contradictions, and that the [[Kingdom of heaven (Gospel of Matthew) | kingdom of heaven]] belongs to children, representing a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit.

## A Faith Beyond Dogma and Ritual
- The described faith is not characterized by fervor, denunciation, or self-defense, and it does not rely on miracles, rewards, promises, or scriptures to manifest itself, instead, it is self-sufficient and lives through its own existence.
- This faith does not formulate itself into specific dogma or creed, but rather, it simply exists and is protected from formulaic expressions, as noted by the author, who draws parallels with the ideas of Perennialism, as discussed by [[Aldous Huxley]].
- The concepts and ideas expressed in primitive [[Christianity]], such as those related to the Last Supper, are seen as symbolic language and semantics, allowing for the use of parables to convey meaning, and it is emphasized that these concepts should not be taken literally.
- The author suggests that [[Jesus]] can be considered a "free spirit" who is unconcerned with established norms and values, and instead, focuses on inner experiences and truths, using words like "life," "truth," and "light" to describe the innermost aspects of human [[Existence | existence]].
- Jesus' teachings and way of life are seen as standing outside of all religion, worship, history, natural science, worldly experience, knowledge, politics, psychology, books, and art, and his "wisdom" is characterized by a pure ignorance of these things, as he is not concerned with culture or the worldly order.
- The author notes that Jesus' teachings do not deny the world, but rather, he is unaware of the ecclesiastical concept of "the world," and this perspective is reflected in his lack of concern for the state, social order, labor, war, and other worldly matters.
- The results of this point of view are seen in the evangelical way of life, which is marked by a different mode of action, including non-resistance, a lack of distinction between strangers and countrymen, and a refusal to appeal to courts of justice or heed their mandates, as noted in the teachings to "swear not at all" and never to divorce.
- The life and death of the Saviour are seen as a manifestation of this way of life, and it is noted that he no longer needed any formula or ritual in his relations with [[God]], not even prayer, and the author wonders if Leo Tolstoy's interpretation of Jesus' teachings was influenced by, or expanded upon, the ideas of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

## The Gospel Way and the Abolition of Jewish Concepts
- The author discusses the concept of repentance and atonement in the Jewish doctrine, stating that it is not through "repentance" or "prayer and forgiveness" that one can reach God, but rather through the [[Gospel]] way, which is considered "God" itself, and this idea abolished the Jewish concepts of "sin," "forgiveness of sin," "faith," and "salvation through faith".
- The author interprets the symbolist, likely referring to Jesus, as someone who regarded only subjective realities as truths, and saw everything else, including natural, temporal, spatial, and historical concepts, as mere signs and materials for parables, with the concept of "the [[Jesus | Son of God]]" being an "eternal" fact and a psychological symbol.
- The author criticizes the crude ecclesiastical notions of God as a person, the "kingdom of God" as a future event, and the "son of God" as the second person of the Trinity, considering these ideas to be a disrespect for symbols and a form of world-historical cynicism, which is being fought against by thinkers such as Spong, Tillich, [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], and Huxley.
- The author explains that the symbolism of the "Son" and "Father" expresses a feeling of transformation and eternity, and that the church has distorted this symbolism, turning it into dogma, such as the concept of "immaculate conception", and that the "[[Kingdom of heaven (Gospel of Matthew) | kingdom of heaven]]" is a state of the heart, not something to come after death.
- The author concludes that the "bearer of glad tidings", likely referring to Jesus, died as he lived and taught, showing mankind how to live, and that his way of life, including his demeanor before his accusers and on the cross, is what he bequeathed to humanity, rather than trying to "save mankind".

## The Misunderstanding of Christianity and the Instinct for Integrity
- The text discusses the concept of [[Christianity]] and how it has been misunderstood over the centuries, with the author arguing that the true meaning of the [[Gospel | Gospels]] has been lost and replaced with a "holy lie" that benefits the church and its followers.
- The author, who refers to themselves as a "free spirit," believes that they are one of the first to understand the true nature of Christianity and the instinct for integrity that it requires, which is to submit to evil and love those who do harm, rather than defending oneself or seeking advantage.
- The author criticizes the church for being an incarnation of "deadly hostility to all honesty, to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all spontaneous and kindly humanity," and argues that the history of Christianity is one of progressively clumsier misunderstanding of the original symbolism of the Gospels.
- The author also critiques modern society for claiming to be Christian while engaging in behaviors that are anti-Christian, such as being a soldier, judge, or patriot, and argues that the modern man must be a "monster of falsehood" to call himself a Christian without shame.
- The author expresses contempt for the modern man and the values of modern society, which they see as being indecent and dishonest, and argues that it is no longer possible to bear the word "truth" being spoken by a priest, implying that the concept of truth has been lost in modern times.
- The author's tone is one of disgust and disillusionment with modern society and the church, and they seem to be calling for a return to a more authentic and honest understanding of the Gospels and the values of Christianity.

## The Holy Lie and the Corruption of Christianity
- The author argues that modern theologians, priests, and popes knowingly lie when speaking about religious concepts, as they are aware that traditional notions of [[God]], sin, and salvation are no longer valid, and that serious reflection and self-conquest of the spirit reveal the truth that these concepts are lies.
- The author contends that the term "[[Christianity]]" is a misunderstanding, as the true Christian way of life, as lived by [[Jesus | Jesus Christ]], was lost after his death on the cross, and what followed was a corruption of his teachings, with the "[[Gospel | Gospels]]" being transformed into "bad tidings" or a "Dysangelium".
- The author asserts that there are no true Christians, as those who claim to be Christian are actually driven by their instincts and have not understood the true teachings of Jesus, which emphasized a way of life characterized by freedom from resentment and superiority to negative feelings.
- The author criticizes the idea of the "kingdom of God" as a future event, with judgment and revenge, and instead suggests that Jesus' teachings were about living in the present, with a sense of unity between God and humanity, and that the concept of guilt and sacrifice was done away with by Jesus himself.
- The author argues that the doctrine of judgment, the second coming, and the resurrection corrupted the original teachings of Jesus, and that [[Buddhism]], in contrast to Christianity, promises nothing but fulfills its teachings, while Christianity promises everything but fulfills nothing.
- The author references [[Vedanta]] and [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]], suggesting that their teachings are in line with the author's own critique of traditional Christianity, and that the true message of Jesus has been lost due to the corruption of his teachings by those who followed him, including the concept of sacrifice and the idea of an afterlife.

## Christianity, Immortality, and the Magnification of Selfishness
- The text discusses the concept of [[Christianity]] and its perceived flaws, with the author arguing that the idea of personal immortality has taken away the centre of gravity of life, leading to a lack of meaning and purpose in living.
- The author criticizes the notion that every individual has an "immortal soul" and is therefore as good as every other, stating that this idea has led to a magnification of selfishness and has been used by Christianity to lure in the dissatisfied and the fallen.
- The author quotes various phrases, including "the salvation of the soul" and "judge not," to highlight the contradictions and hypocrisies within Christianity, and argues that the religion teaches a misunderstanding of the body and refuses to rid itself of superstition about the soul.
- The author also discusses the concept of a [[God | god]] who intervenes in everyday life, stating that such a god would be seen as absurd and would have to be abolished, and criticizes the idea that a cause is made more worthy by the fact that someone has laid down their life for it.
- The text also touches on the idea of scepticism, with the author stating that great intellects are sceptical, and that a mind that aspires to great things must be able to see beyond fixed convictions and consider multiple perspectives, citing Zarathustra as an example of a sceptic.
- The author references various philosophers, including [[Søren Kierkegaard | Kierkegaard]] and Tolstoy, to support their arguments, and argues that a healthy and contemptuous approach to life is necessary to truly understand and critique the values and lack of values in society.
- Overall, the text presents a critical and philosophical examination of [[Christianity]] and its values, arguing that the religion has been used to promote selfishness and has led to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the human body and the natural world.

## Freedom from Conviction and the Limits of Reason
- The section from the document 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal' discusses various philosophical ideas, including the concept of freedom from conviction, which belongs to strength and an independent point of view, as stated by the author, and the importance of knowing the limits of reason, which is considered genuine philosophy.
- The text criticizes priestly organizations and the concepts of "law," "will of [[God]]," "[[Religious text | holy book]]," and "inspiration," which are seen as means for priests to gain and maintain power, and notes that even philosophers like [[Plato]] and Confucius have used the "holy lie" to promote their ideas, with the author also referencing the ideas of Eugene Seraphim and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].
- The author argues that true goodness and beauty are privileges of the superior caste, which is composed of the most intellectual individuals, and that only they have the right to beauty and goodness, as stated in the phrase "Pulchrum est paucorum hominum," which means goodness is a privilege.
- The text also touches on the idea of [[Nihilism | nihilism]] and the concept of a "beyond" that is seen as the death of life, with the author noting that Friedrich Nietzsche's view of nihilism was misinterpreted as naturalism and a revolt, rather than a complete reduction of the earthly with a "drowning" into the Other.
- The [[Christianity | Christian]] church is criticized for turning every value into worthlessness and every truth into a lie, and for promoting a "state" where all individuals lose themselves and engage in a slow suicide, which is called "life," as described in Friedrich Nietzsche's book "[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]".
- The author praises poverty and simplicity, stating that "he who possesses little is so much the less possessed," and notes that the world revolves around the inventors of new values, while the people and glory revolve around the actors, highlighting the difference between true creators and those who seek fame and power.
- The text concludes by stating that values are assigned to things by humans in order to maintain themselves, and that human significance is created by assigning significance to things, which is a key idea in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, as referenced in the text.

## Humanity's Lack of Unified Goal and the Importance of Self-Attachment
- The text discusses the concept of humanity and its lack of a unified goal, with the author stating that "humanity has not a goal" and that the individual's attachment to themselves is what gives life value, as they "attach more importance to himself than he does to the world".
- The author critiques the idea of a collective conscience, suggesting that individuals who seek to break free from the "herd" will face difficulties and inner turmoil, as they will still hear the "voice of the herd" echoing within them, and that "all isolation is wrong" is a notion that is deeply ingrained in human nature.
- The text also explores the idea that humans are "primordially illogical and hence unjust beings" and that this is a fundamental discord of [[Existence | existence]], as stated in the book "Human All Too Human", which highlights the flaws in human judgment and the tendency to form estimates based on partiality and aversion.
- The author argues that the majority of people endure life without questioning its value, but those who can sympathize with the suffering of others and see the bigger picture will necessarily doubt the value of life, and that this realization can lead to a sense of despair and hopelessness, as they will "collapse with a malediction against existence".
- The text questions the possibility of knowingly remaining in a state of untruth and whether death might be preferable, as the traditional notions of morality and religion have been annihilated, and that the only remaining motives are pleasure, pain, benefit, and injury, which are all based on error and partiality.
- The author suggests that a life lived without the influence of external opinions and expectations, where one can live "as in the natural state, without praise, reproach, competition", would be a more authentic and truthful way of living, and that even suicide can be seen as a rational and respectable act in certain circumstances, as it was during the times of the Greek philosophers and Roman patriots.

## Delusions, Egoism, and the Critique of Asceticism
- The text discusses various philosophical ideas, including the concept of eagerness to stay alive despite not being able to attain one's ideal of life, which is considered less worthy of respect, and the idea that people often explain their symptoms of sickness as something more profound due to deep-rooted delusions, as seen in the example of the saint and Socrates' demon.
- It also explores the idea that individuals compare themselves to a being who embodies unegoistic conduct, such as [[God]], which leads to discontentment with oneself, and that people only feel emotions for themselves, not for others, but rather for the feelings that others inspire in them, as stated in the phrase "we feel only for ourselves."
- The text critiques the dogmas of asceticism, humility, and sanctity, suggesting that they are a form of vanity, where individuals master themselves through exaggerated pretensions and later deify this tyrannically exacting part of themselves, as seen in the ethic of the [[Sermon on the Mount | sermon on the mount]], and that in every scheme of ascetic ethics, man prays to one part of himself as if it were God.
- Additionally, the text touches on the idea that in pessimistic religions, the act of procreation is often viewed as evil in itself, and that [[Christianity | Christian]] pessimists have a direct interest in promoting an opposite belief, as stated by the author, who also references his own work, "Zarathustra", and quotes himself, saying "he who would be a creator in good and evil-verily, he must first be a destroyer, and break values into pieces."
- The author, who refers to himself as "the most terrible man that has ever existed", also discusses the idea that the condition of the [[Existence | existence]] of the good is falsehood, or the refusal to see how reality is actually constituted, and that considering distress as an objection to be done away with is nonsense, as it is a natural part of life, and that the will to abolish bad things, such as bad weather, out of pity, is a form of fatal stupidity.
- The text concludes with the author's statement that he will become the most beneficent, despite being considered the most terrible man, and that the greatest evil belongs to the greatest good, which is the creative good, as expressed in his work, "Ecce Homo" and "Zarathustra".

## Reality, Suffering, and the Path to Greatness
- The passage discusses the concept of reality and the human experience, highlighting the importance of acknowledging the darker aspects of life, such as terror and suffering, rather than striving for a superficial form of happiness or "goodness" that is based on a falsification of instincts.
- According to Nietzsche, as expressed through his character Zarathustra, the traditional notion of "goodness" is actually a hindrance to true greatness, and that one must be strong enough to confront reality as it is, with all its terrible and questionable characteristics, in order to achieve true greatness.
- The author notes that Zarathustra's goal is to conceive of a type of person who can see [[Existence | reality]] as it is, without being estranged or removed from it, and that this person would be able to embody the complexities and contradictions of reality, much like the ideas expressed by [[Swami Vivekananda | Vivekananda]].
- Nietzsche also touches on the idea that morality is a form of masking, and that once one unmasks morality, they also unmask the worthlessness of the values that people hold dear, leading to a profound disillusionment with the concept of reverence and holiness.
- The author reflects on their own experiences, noting that they have mastered the ability to see both sides of an issue, whether it be Theism or Naturalism, and that they have developed a unique perspective through their experiences of suffering and physiological weakness.
- Nietzsche describes how they have cultivated a sense of intellectual clarity and cheerfulness, even in the midst of great physical suffering, and that this has allowed them to think through complex ideas with a level of detachment and objectivity.
- The author also discusses their decision to embrace solitude and self-discipline, refusing to be pampered or tended to, and how this has allowed them to develop a deeper understanding of themselves and their instincts.
- Finally, Nietzsche notes that while an intrinsically morbid nature cannot become healthy, an intrinsically sound nature can actually be stimulated by illness, leading to a surplus of life and a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human experience, as referenced by authors such as Huxley, [[Augustine of Hippo | Augustine]], and Luther, and also in contrast to perspectives like Dawkins' "joyful universe" and the author's own "Nihiltheism".

## Nietzsche's Will to Health and Life
- The author, who appears to be [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], reflects on a period of illness in his life, during which he discovered a new appreciation for life and developed his own philosophy, which he calls his "Will to Health and to Life".
- Nietzsche explains that he attacks and critiques things that are triumphant and unopposed, and that he does so alone, without compromising others, which is a unique aspect of his philosophical approach, and he notes that this approach is a result of his nihilistic experience.
- The author values solitude and self-mastery, and believes that his humanity consists not in understanding the feelings of others, but in his ability to endure and understand them, and that he needs solitude to recover and return to himself.
- Nietzsche expresses his disdain for traditional religious notions, such as the concept of [[God]], the immortality of the soul, and salvation, which he sees as clumsy and unsatisfying solutions to the complexities of life, and he notes that his rejection of these notions is instinctive and inherent to his nature.
- The author also critiques the scholar, who he sees as a decadent figure, exhausted by the constant need to respond to and critique the thoughts of others, and unable to think independently or defend himself against the influence of books.
- Additionally, Nietzsche touches on the idea of escape, suggesting that some people may turn to substances like hashish to escape from feelings of oppression, but he emphasizes that the true question is not the escape itself, but where the escape leads, implying that true freedom and liberation can only be achieved through a deeper understanding of oneself and the world.

## Solitude, Self-Mastery, and the Limits of Scholarship
- The author reflects on how gifted individuals can be worn out by the age of thirty, and criticizes the habit of reading books early in the morning, calling it "positively vicious", as stated in the book "[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You | The Kingdom of God is Within You]]".
- The author shares an anecdote about Dr. Heinrich von Stein's struggle to understand the author's book "Zarathustra", and notes that to truly understand the book, one must have lived the experiences described in it, which can elevate a person to a higher level of understanding.
- The author discusses how people can only draw from books what they already know, and that experience is necessary to truly hear and understand the messages conveyed in a book, highlighting the idea that "no one can draw more out of things, books included, than he already knows".
- The author criticizes those who dismiss their work, including so-called friends who assume an "impersonal" tone when discussing their books, and notes that their writings are often met with superficial praise, such as congratulations on producing another work.

## The Hypnotic Sensation of Nothingness and the Ascetic Ideal
- The author explores the concept of the "hypnotic sensation of nothingness" and how it can be a source of comfort for those who suffer, as discussed in the book "On the Genealogy of Morals", and how this sensation can be achieved through mechanical activity, regularity, and self-forgetfulness.
- The author examines the ascetic ideal and how it arises from a sense of lack and a need for self-justification, with the ascetic priest exploiting methods such as mechanical activity and self-forgetfulness to distract from pain and suffering, as described in the book "On the Genealogy of Morals".
- The text discusses the human experience of suffering and the need for a meaning or purpose behind it, as suffering itself is not the problem, but rather the senselessness of suffering, with the ascetic ideal providing a meaning to suffering by giving it a purpose.
- The ascetic ideal is described as a will for Nothingness, a will opposed to life, and a repudiation of the fundamental conditions of life, which is characterized by a hate of the human, animal, and material, and a horror of the senses, reason, happiness, and beauty.
- The text also references the Schopenhauerian theory, which glorifies music as the independent art-in-itself, speaking directly from the "abyss" and representing the language of the will, as understood by Schopenhauer, with a mention of [[Johann Sebastian Bach | Bach]] in this context.
- Additionally, the text critiques the idea that it is shameful to be happy when there is misery in the world, arguing that the healthy should not doubt their right to happiness and should separate themselves from the sick to prevent the spread of sickness, with a quote from "[[Beyond Good and Evil]]" emphasizing the importance of this separation.
- The text further explores the concept of philosophy as a form of autobiography, where the moral purpose of a philosopher's work is the vital germ from which the entire philosophy grows, and understanding the morality behind a philosopher's assertions is essential to grasping their metaphysical ideas, as noted in "Beyond Good and Evil".
- The text concludes by highlighting the relationship between intellectual vision and the expansion of one's world, where new ideas and enigmas come into view as one's insight and acuteness grow, and the importance of recognizing the role of morality in shaping philosophical ideas, with references to the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], including "Beyond Good and Evil".

## The Decay of Religious Instincts and the Rise of Superficiality
- The text discusses the concept of [[God]] and sin, suggesting that these ideas may one day be viewed as insignificant, much like a child's plaything, and that humanity may always be childish in its pursuit of new ideas and distractions.
- The author notes that many people in Germany have lost their religious instincts due to generations of laboriousness, and now view religion with dull astonishment, being too occupied with their daily lives to consider its purpose or relevance.
- The author also observes that people who have delved deeply into the world have discovered that it is often necessary for individuals to be superficial in order to cope with the complexities and difficulties of life, and that this superficiality can be a preservative instinct that teaches people to be flighty and false.
- Additionally, the text touches on the idea that some individuals, such as artists and philosophers, may be driven to create or seek out superficial or falsified representations of life as a way of taking revenge on the world or avoiding the truth, and that this can be a sign of a deeper pessimism or fear of the truth.
- The author criticizes the idea of "equality before God" and the type of person it produces, describing them as a "dwarfed, almost ludicrous species" that is gregarious, sickly, and mediocre, and suggests that this type of person has swayed the destiny of Europe.
- The text also includes quotes and references to various thinkers, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who is not directly mentioned but is implied to be the author of the text, as well as [[Martin Luther]], who is quoted as saying that he would rather die than continue living in a world that is "full of nothing but devils".
- Furthermore, the author notes that the thought of suicide can be a great consolation for getting through difficult times, and that fighting with monsters can lead to becoming a monster, highlighting the importance of being mindful of one's own nature and the dangers of gazing into the abyss.
- The text concludes by referencing the idea that works are not condemned, but rather devalued because they are earthly, suggesting that there is a tension between the spiritual and the material realms.

## The Importance of the Other and Luther's Bondage of the Will
- The text emphasizes that the only thing that truly matters is not of this earth, but rather [[God]], faith in God, contemplation, non-movement, pacifism, and renouncement of earthly things for the Other, as highlighted by quotes such as "The more [[Christianity | Christian]] a man is, the more evils, sufferings, and deaths he must endure" and "Therefore the moment you begin to have faith you learn that all things in you are altogether blameworthy, sinful, and damnable".
- The author discusses the importance of prayer, rituals, and ceremonies as a means to appreciate and possibly experience the Other, but notes that they should not be elevated above their intended purpose, and mentions that Luther, in his work "Bondage of the Will", diminishes the concept of free will in order to emphasize the value and ground of all value in God.
- Luther's argument is that knowing whether or not the will plays a role in salvation is essential to understanding Christian matters, and that if one does not know this, they will be uncertain and ignorant of God's role and ability, as stated in quotes such as "Therefore, it is not irreligious, curious, or superfluous, but essentially wholesome and necessary, for a Christian to know, whether or not the will does any thing in those things which pertain unto Salvation".
- The text also highlights Luther's belief that God foreknows and purposes all things according to His immutable and eternal will, which throws the concept of free will into question, and that those who assert free will must either deny or ignore this aspect of God's nature, as stated in quotes such as "THIS, therefore, is also essentially necessary and wholesome for Christians to know: That God foreknows nothing by contingency, but that He foresees, purposes, and does all things according to His immutable, eternal, and infallible will".
- The author notes that Luther's stance on these issues is not driven by personal gain or vanity, but rather by a deep conviction and commitment to his faith, as evident in quotes such as "For, by the grace of God, I am not so great a fool or madman, as to have desired to sustain and defend this cause so long, with so much fortitude and so much firmness".

## Faith, Worldly Powers, and the Word of God
- The author of the text expresses a preference to endure temporal struggles while maintaining their faith in [[God]], rather than facing eternal torment and wrath, and hopes that the reader's heart is not hardened against the Word of God.
- The author criticizes the idea of compromising on the Word of God for the sake of worldly powers, such as the Popes, and instead emphasizes the importance of prioritizing faith and salvation above all else, as instructed by [[Jesus | Christ]].
- The text highlights the contrast between the world's values and the teachings of the [[Gospel]], noting that the Gospel reveals the true nature of the world's evil, and that people often mistakenly blame the Gospel for the world's problems.
- The author discusses the concept of humility and salvation, stating that God promises grace to the humbled, and that true humility can only be achieved when one recognizes that their salvation is entirely dependent on God's will and not on their own efforts or works.
- The text references biblical [[Religious text | scripture]], specifically I Samuel 2:6, to illustrate God's power to both kill and make alive, bring down to the grave and raise up, and notes that this concept is a familiar theme in the author's writings, which suggests that the reader is likely already familiar with these ideas, possibly from the author's previous works, such as those referenced in the larger document titled 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal'.

## God's Nature, Mercy, and Wrath
- The concept of God's nature is discussed, highlighting the idea that He conceals His eternal mercy and loving-kindness behind His eternal wrath, and His righteousness behind apparent iniquity, as noted in the quotes from the document 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal'.
- The highest degree of faith is described as believing that [[God]] is merciful, despite saving few and damning many, and believing Him to be just, even when He makes humans necessarily damnable according to His own will, as mentioned by Erasmus, who suggests that God may seem to delight in the torments of the miserable.
- The power of "Free-will" is debated, with the acknowledgment that without the grace of God, it is utterly ineffective, and that if the grace of God is wanting or taken away, human "Free-will" can do nothing good on its own, as stated in the quotes.
- A distinction is made between the use of "Free-will" in earthly matters, where humans have the right to use, act, and omit according to their will, and in spiritual matters, where humans have no "Free-will" and are instead captive to the will of God or [[Satan]], as discussed in the context of the 'Journal314_Quotes_FInal' document.
- The human heart is described as being bound by the power of Satan, requiring the quickening of the [[Holy Spirit | Spirit of God]] to see or hear things that are manifestly evident, highlighting the limitations of human "Free-will" in spiritual matters, as noted in the quotes from the document.
