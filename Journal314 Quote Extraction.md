You will be provided with two input variables:  
\
{$QUOTES}: A set of quotes from prominent figures, organized by the source document "Journal314\_{47-51}".  
{$THEMES}: A list of themes that the quotes should be organized and analyzed under.  
\
Your task is to generate responses for each theme that showcase relevant quotes, analyze how the quotes relate to the theme, and discuss how the quotes can be applied to illustrate the theme.  
\
Here is the format you should follow for each theme:  
\
\### {THEME}  
\- \*\*Quote from {AUTHOR}\*\*: "{QUOTE}"  
  - \*\*Analysis\*\*: Provide an analysis of how this quote relates to the theme.  
  - \*\*Application\*\*: Discuss how this quote can be used to illustrate or apply the theme.  
\
Repeat this format for each relevant quote under the theme. If there are no relevant quotes for a particular theme, simply state "No relevant quotes."  
\
Make sure to replace the {THEME}, {AUTHOR}, and {QUOTE} placeholders with the actual values from the input variables. Do not include any additional text or formatting beyond what is specified in the example structure.  
\
After generating responses for all the themes, your final output should be a complete set of themed quote analyses, with each theme section following the prescribed format.
