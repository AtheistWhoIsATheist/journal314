[START PART 9/15]
ature of religious experience abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the Mysterium tremendum. In theological language, this fear is due to the incompatibility between man’s egotism and the divine purity, between man’s self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of God n of the infinite in a finite particular is a revelation of divine immanence; for Renee, it was a revelation of what she calls 'the System', the vast cosmic mechanism which exists only to grind out guilt and punishment, solitude and unreality.”

- “Sanity is a matter of degree, and there are plenty of visionaries who see the world as Renee saw it, but contrive, none the less, to live outside the asylum. For them, as for the positive visionary, the universe is transfigured - but for the worse. Everything in it, from the stars in the sky to the dust under their feet, is unspeakably sinister or disgusting; every event is charged with a hateful significance; every object manifests the presence of an Indwelling Horror, infinite, all-powerful, eternal.”
- “But what is more important for our present purposes is the fact that negative visionary experience may be induced by purely psychological means. Fear and anger bar the way to
the heavenly Other World and plunge the mescalin taker into hell.”
- “Upon this psychological foundation has been reared the theological doctrine of saving faith - a
doctrine to be met with in all the great religious traditions of the world.  Eschatologists have always found it difficult to reconcile their rationality and their morality with the brute facts of psychological experience.  As rationalists and moralists, they feel that good behavior should be rewarded and that the virtuous deserve to go to heaven. But as psychologists they know that virtue is not the sole or sufficient condition of blissful visionary experience. They know that works alone are powerless and that it is faith, or loving confidence, which guarantees that visionary experience shall be blissful.  Negative emotions - the fear which is the absence
of confidence, the hatred, anger, or malice which exclude love - are the guarantee that
visionary experience, if and when it comes, shall be appalling. The Pharisee is a virtuous man; but his virtue is of the kind which is compatible with negative emotion. His visionary experiences are therefore likely to be infernal rather than blissful.  The nature of the mind is such that the sinner who repents and makes an act of faith in a higher power is more likely to have a blissful visionary experience than is the self-satisfied pillar of society with his righteous indignations, his anxiety about possessions and pretensions, his ingrained habits of blaming, despising, and condemning. Hence the enormous importance attached, in all the great religious traditions,
to the state of mind at the moment of death.”
- “In life, even the blissful visionary experience tends to change its sign if it persists too long. Many schizophrenics have their times of heavenly happiness; but the fact that (unlike
the mescalin taker) they do not know when, if ever, they will be permitted to return to the reassuring banality of everyday experience causes even heaven to seem appalling.  But for those who, for whatever reason, are appalled, heaven turns into hell, bliss into horror, the Clear
Light into the hateful glare of the land of lit-upness.”
- “Of those who die an infinitesimal minority are capable of immediate union with the divine Ground, a few are capable of supporting the visionary bliss of heaven, a few find themselves in the visionary horrors of hell and are unable to escape; the great majority end up in the kind of world described by Swedenborg and the mediums. From this in world it is doubtless possible to pass, when the necessary conditions have been fulfilled, to worlds of visionary bliss or the final enlightenment.  My own guess is that modern spiritualism and ancient tradition are both correct. There is a posthumous state of the kind described in Sir Oliver Lodge's book, Raymond; but there is also a heaven of blissful visionary experience; there is also a hell of the same kind of appalling visionary experience as is suffered here by schizophrenics and some of those who take
mescalin; and there is also an experience, beyond time, of union with the divine Ground.”
- “Mortification of the body may produce a host of undesirable mental symptoms; but it may also open a door into a transcendental world of Being, Knowledge, and Bliss. That is why, in spite of its obvious disadvantages, almost all aspirants to the spiritual life have, in the past, undertaken
regular courses of bodily mortification.”
- ““How many philosophers, how many theologians, how many professional educators have had the curiosity to open this Door in the Wall? The answer, for all practical purposes, is, None.”  (Mckenna, James, sad that there isn't more)

The Perennial Philosophy

- “...the ultimate Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended, except by those who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit. This being so, it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the experience of nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so little conviction.  This kind of empirical theology is on precisely the same footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience of naked-eye observers.” (Plato's cave, psychedelics)
- “...no saint or founder of a religion, no exponent of the Perennial Philosophy, has ever been optimistic.  'Many are called, but few are chosen.'
- “The Christ of the Gospels is a preacher and not a dispenser of sacraments or performer of rites; he speaks against vain repetitions; he insists on the supreme importance of private worship; he has no use for sacrafices and not much use for the Temple.  But this did not prevent historic Christianity from going on its own, all too human, way.
- “For long periods of history and prehistory it would seem that men and women, though perfectly capable of doing so, did not wish to pay attention to problems, which their descendents found absorbingly interesting.”
- “Certain thoughts are practically unthinkable except in terms of an appropriate language and within the framework of an appropriate system.”
- “...from imbecility to Quantum Theory...to the intuitive knowledge of the Godhead, or to manufacture self-propelled flame-throwers...It is clear that many of the things in which modern men have chosen to pay attention to were ignored by their predecessors.  Consequently the very means for thinking clearly and fruitfully about those things remained uninvented, not merely during prehistoric times, but even to the opening of the modern era.”
- “...in modern industrialized societies, a few people work their way out of the prevailing occupation with matter and through the prevailing habits of analytical thought into the direct experience of the spiritual Ground of things.” (Jnana)
- “The last end of man, the ultimate reason for human existence, is unitive knowledge of the divine Ground...very few will achieve the final end of human existence.”
- “...they who know Him most perfectly perceive most clearly that He is infinitely incomprehensible...”
- “...it is easier for us to reach our goal if we are not handicapped by a set of erroneous or inadequate beliefs about the right way to get there and the nature of what we are looking for.”
- “The best that can be said for ritualistic legalism is that it improves conduct.  It does little, however, to alter character and nothing of itself to modify consciousness.”  (good to be born in a church, bad to die in one)
- “Nobody has yet invented a Spiritual Calculus, in terms of which we may talk coherently about the divine Ground and of the world conceived as its manifestation.  For the present, therefore, we must be patient with the linguistic eccentricities of those who are compelled to describe one order of experience in terms of a symbol-system, whose relevance is to the facts of another and quite different order.”
- “In statements such as Eckhart's, God is equated with nothing.”
- Quoting “The Cloud of the Unknowing: “This sorrow, if it be truly conceived, is full of holy desire...” (Tolstoy, Vivekananda, Tillich)
- “Sometimes crisis alone, without any preparatory training, is sufficient to make a man forget to be his customary self and become, for the time being, something quite different.”
- “The saint is one who knows that every moment of our human life is a moment of crisis; for at every moment we are called upon to make an all-important decision- to choose between the way that leads to death and the spiritual darkness and the way that leads towards light and life; between interests exclusively temporal and the eternal order...”
- “...for the lover of God, every moment is a moment crisis, spiritual training is incomparably more difficult and searching than military training.  There are many good soldiers, few saints.”
- “...the aim of spiritual training is to make people become selfless in every circumstance of life, while the aim of military training is to make them selfless only in certain very special circumstances and in relation to only certain classes of human beings.”
- “But if the Gospels tell us very little about the “I” which was Jesus, they make up for this deficiency by telling us inferentially, in the parables and discourses, a good deal about the spiritual “not-I,” whose manifest presence in the mortal man was the reason why his disciples called him the Christ and identified him with the eternal Logos.” (Spong, Vivekananda)
- “The doctrine that God is in the world...the sacredness of nature, and the sinfulness and folly of man's overwhelming efforts to be her master rather than her intelligently docile collaborator.” (Vivekananda, Karma Yoga)
- “…for some inexplicable reason, the travellers still hold fast to the religion of Inevitable Progress...every victory must be paid for...It is because the reality of Progress can never be determined that...the Perennial Philosophy, the question whether Progress is inevitable or even real is not a matter of primary importance...the important thing is that individual men and women should come to the unitive knowledge of the divine Ground, and what interests them in regard to the social environment is not its progressiveness or non-progressiveness (whatever those terms may mean), but the degree to which it helps or hinders individuals in their advance towards man's final end.” (beyond good and evil, Vivekananda, Seraphim)
- “The world inhabited by ordinary, nice, unregenerate people is mainly dull (so dull that they have to ditract their minds from being aware of it by all sorts of artificial 'amusements') sometimes briefly and intensely pleasurable, occasionally or quite often disagreeable and even agonizing.”
- “The slime of personal and emotional love is remotely similar to the water of the Godhead's spiritual being, but of inferior and of insufficient quantity...human beings can do something to mitigate the horrors of their situation by 'keeping one another wet with their slime.'  But there can be no happiness or safety in time and no deliverance into eternity, until they give up thinking that slime is enough and, by abandoning themselves to what is in fact their element, call back the eternal waters...the modern idolaters of progress...prefer an agonizing and impossible existence on dry land to love, joy and peace in our native ocean.”  (Vivekananda, Maya, Earthly/Other)
- “...the Perennial Philosophy will do something to preserve men and women from the temptation to idolatrous worship of things in time- church-worship, state-worship, revolutionary future-worship, humanistic self-worship, all of them essentially and necessarily opposed to charity.”
- “To the extent that there is attachment to 'I,' 'Me,' 'Mine,' there is no attachment to, and therefore no unitive knowledge of, the divine Ground.”  (psychedelics, ego-death)
- “To sum up, that mortification is the best which results in the elimination of self-will, self-interest, self-centered thinking, wishing and imagining...which means, in practice, refraining from about fifty percent of ordinary conversations...to achieve a 'holy indifference' to the temporal success or failure of the cause to which one has devoted one's best energies.” (Tillich, Quietism, Karma, Vivekananda)
- “Until we put an end to particular attachments, there can be no love of God with the whole heart, mind and strength and no universal charity towards all creatures for God's sake.  Hence the hard sayings of the Gospels about the need to renounce exclusive family ties.”
- “Mortification is painful...This fact of spiritual experience is sometimes obscured by the language in which it is described...Seen through the dung-colored spectacles of self-interest, the universe looks singularly like a dung-heap.”
- “Those who choose the profession of artist, philosopher, or man of science, choose, in many cases, a life of poverty and unrewarded hard work.”
- “...the critical philosophy must mortify his commonsense...”
- “The verbal statements of theology's more or less adequate rationalizations of experience have been taken too seriously and treated with reverence that is due only to the Fact they are intended to describe.  It has been fancied that souls are saved if assent is given to what is logically regarded as the correct formula, lost if it is withheld.” (Ha!  Symbolism, God is too big to be bound by language)
- “Most human beings are not philosophers and care not at all for consistency in thought or action.” (Ha!)
- “The poet is born with the capacity of arranging words...This is a great and precious gift; but if the poet remains content with his gift, if he persists in worshiping the beauty in art and nature without going on to make himself capable, through selflessness, of apprehending Beauty as it is in the divine Ground, then he is only an idolater.”
- “Rational intelligence makes possible unparalleled success on the one hand and, on the other, a further advance towards spirituality and a return, through unitive knowledge, to the divine ground.” (Kierkegaard, Vivekananda, Jnana)
- “The orthodox doctrine of the Atonement attributes to God characteristics that would be discredible even to a human potentate, and its model of the universe is not the product of spiritual insight rationalized by philosophical reflection, but rather the projection of a lawyer's phantasy.” (Ha!)
- “'Turning to God without turning from self' – the formula is absurdly simple; and yet, simple as it is, it explains all the follies and iniquities committed in the name of religion.”
- “The Christ of the Gospels is a preacher and not a dispenser of sacraments or performer of rites; he speaks against vain repetitions; he insists on the supreme importance of private worship; he has no use for sacrifices and not much use for the Temple. But this did not prevent historic Christianity from going its own, all too human way.”
- “For the Buddha of the Pali scriptures, ritual was one of the fetters holding back the soul from enlightenment and liberation.  Nevertheless, the religion he founded has made full use of ceremonies, vain repetitions and sacramental rites.”
- “The righteous man can escape suffering only by accepting it and passing beyond it...by being converted from righteousness to total selflessness and God-centeredness, by ceasing to be just a Pharisee, or good citizen...The difficulties...are...enormous...those who 'speak with authority,' who has ever said that the road to complete deliverance was easy or the gate anything but 'strait and narrow'?”
- “...an immense increase in technical and governmental efficiency and an immense increase in scientific knowledge- each of them a result of the general shift of Western man's attention from the eternal to the temporal order...”
- “'vain repetition...to use the name of God to justify what they do in pursuit of place, power and wealth.”
- “The moralists cease to be realistic and commit idolatry inasmuch as they worship, not God, but their own ethical ideals, inasmuch as they treat virtue as an end in itself and not as t he necessary condition of the knowledge and love of God- a knowledge and love, without which that virtue will never be made perfect or even socially effective.”
- “Our education disparages the more primitive forms of idolatry; but at the same time it disparages, or at the best it ignores, the Perennial Philosophy and the practice of spirituality.  In place of mumbo-jumbo at the bottom and the immanent and transcendent Godhead at the top, it sets up, as objects of admiration, faith and worship, a pantheon of strictly human ideas and ideals.”
- “In academic circles, and among those who have been subjected to higher education, there are few fetishists and few devout contemplatives; but the enthusiastic devotees of some form of political or social idolatry are as common as blackberries.” (Ha! Ben Shapiro and Milo)
- “Self-re[roach is painful; but the very pain is a reassuring proof that the self is still intact: so long as attention is fixed on the delinquent ego, it cannot be fixed upon God...”
- “The religious systems of the world have been built up, in the main, by men and women who were not completely selfless or enlightened.  Hence all religions have had their dark and even frightful aspects, while the good they do is rarely gratuitous, but must, in most cases, be paid for, either on the nail or by installments.”
- “It is permissible to seek God provisionally under a form which is from the first recognized as merely a symbol of Reality, and a symbol which must sooner or later be discarded in favour of what it stands for.  To seek Him under a settled form – settled because regarded as the very shape of Reality – is to commit onself to illusion and a kind of idolatry.”  (Good to be born in a church, bad to die in a church, Vivekananda)
- “Probably all persons, even the most saintly, suffer to some extent from distractions...make use of distractions.”
- “Self-knowledge, leading to self-hatred and humility, is the condition of the love and knowledge of God.”
- “Professionally, in relation to his chosen specialty, a man may be completely mature.  Spiritually and sometimes even ethically, in relation to God and his neighbors, he may be hardly more than a fetus.” (Ha!)
- 

“Beliefs” (an essay printed at the end of The Perennial Philosophy)

- “Arbitrarily, because it happens to be convenient, because his methods do not allow him to deal with the immense complexity of reality, he selects from the whole of experience only those elements which can be weighed, measured, numbered, or which lend themselves in any other way to mathematical treatment.”
- “...many men of science have come to realize that the scientific picture of the world is a partial one – the product of their special competence in mathematics and their special incompetence to deal systematically with aesthetic and moral values, religious experiences and intuitions of significance.”
- “The masses,...are convinced that the scientific picture of an arbitrary abstraction from reality is a picture of reality as a whole and that therefore the world is without meaning or value.  But nobody likes living in such a world.  To satisfy their hunger for meaning and value, they turn to such doctrines as nationalism, fascism and revolutionary communism.  Philosophically and scientifically, these doctrines are absurd; but for the masses in every community, they have this great merit: they attribute the meaning and value that have been taken away from the world as a whole to the particular part of the world in which the believers happen to be living.” (the influence of Positivism has trickled down for a little more than a century and it has corrupted the thought process and worldviews of almost everyone without their even knowing it!  Ha!)
- “...the philosophy of meaninglessness carried to its logical conclusion.  Life was without significance.  Values were illusory and ideals merely the inventions of cunning priests and kings.  Sensations and animal pleasures alone possessed reality and were alone worth living for.  There was no reason why any one should have the slightest consideration for any one else. For those who found rape and murder amusing, rape and murder were fully legitimate activities.  And so on.”
- “If it is legitimate to torment and kill in one set of circumstances, it must be equally legitimate to torment and kill in all other circumstances.”
- “The general acceptance of a doctrine that denies meaning and value to the world as a whole,
while assigning them in a supreme degree to certain arbitrarily selected parts of the totality, can only have evil and disastrous results...We have thought of ourselves as members of supremely meaningful and valuable communities – deified nations, divine classes and what not – existing within a meaningless universe.” (Ha!)
- “...supplying the masses with 'vital lies' calculated to make those who accepted them not only happy, but well behaved. The truth – which was that there was no meaning or value in the world – should be revealed only to the few who were strong enough to stomach it.”
- “Some people, it is true, can live contentedly with a philosophy of meaninglessness for a very long time.  But in most cases it will be found that these people possess some talent or accomplishment that permits them to live a life which, to a limited extent, is profoundly meaningful and valuable.  Thus an artist, or a man of science can profess a philosophy of general meaninglessness and yet lead a perfectly contented life...artistic creation and scientific research are absorbingly delightful occupations...They are proclaimed to be ends absolutely in themselves – ends so admirable that those who pursue them are excused from bothering about anything else.” (Ha!  This is Becker! this lack of 'talent' is the driving force of 'mental illness', it comes down to 'stupidity' or not being able to express or 'let out' the crazy thoughts within, maybe even deeper- it would be that the expressions, beyond stupidity or inability to produce expressions, themselves lose all meaning for the person; therefore a person cannot move forward, since the last illusion, the illusion of one's own fulfillment/happiness, is shown to be utterly ludicrous: Nietzsche's 'great contempt', Bertrand Russell's response to Durant about being 'too busy' to discuss the meaning of life, Ha!)
- “Meditation, in other words, is the technique of mysticism...'transcendental consciousness' – the direct intuition of an ultimate spiritual reality that is perceived as simultaneously beyond the self and in some way within it.”
- “First Bach fugues, a bore...But training changes the structure of our spiritual experiences.  In due course, contact with an obscurely beautiful poem, an elaborate piece of counterpoint or of mathematical reasoning, causes us to feel direct intuitions of beauty and significance.” (participation, head held under water)
- “Systematic training in recollection and meditation makes possible the mystical experience, which is a direct intuition of ultimate reality.”
- “The direct intuition of an impersonal spiritual reality, underlying all being, is in accord with the findings of the majority of the world's philosophers.”
- “If he is to transcend the limitations of man's private universe he must be a member of a community which gives him protection against the inclemencies of the environment and makes it easy for him to supply his physical wants.  But this is not enough.  He must also train himself in the art of being dispassionate and disinterested, must cultivate intellectual curiosity for its own sake and not for what he, as an animal, can get out of it.”
- “Only the disinterested mind can transcend commonsense and pass beyond the boundaries of animal or average-sensual human life.  The mystic exhibits disinterestedness in the highest degree possible to human beings and is therefore able to transcend ordinary limitations more completely than the man of science, the artist or the philosopher.” (maybe the Real Philosopher in his Nothingness/Meaninglessness is at a farther point than the mystic who claims constant 'bliss')
- “We fail to attend to our true relations with ultimate reality and, through ultimate reality, with our fellow beings, because we prefer to to attend to our animal nature and to the business of getting on in the world.”
- “Mysticism...is unsatisfactory in moral content.  The ultimate reality of the world is not moral ('God is not good') and the mystic who unites himself with ultimate reality is uniting himself with a non-moral being, therefore he is not moral.” (beyond good and evil, Nihiltheism)

1. John Bunyan

- “One morning as I lay in my bed, I was, as at other times, most fiercely assaulted with this temptation to sell and part with Christ, the wicked suggestion still running in my mind, “Sell Him, sell Him, sell Him, sell Him,” as fast as a man could speak. Against this I also in my mind, as at other times, I answered, “No, no, not for thousands, thousands, thousands,” at least twenty times together. At last, after much striving, even until I was almost out of breath, I felt this thought pass through my heart, “Let Him go if He will.” I thought also that I felt my heart freely consent to this. Oh, the diligence of Satan! Oh, the desperateness of man’s heart! Now was the battle won, and down I fell, as a bird that is shot from the top of a tree, into great guilt and fearful despair. Now I was as one bound; I felt myself shut up into the judgment to come. Nothing for the next two years would abide with me but damnation and an expectation of damnation.
I did ever so know now what it was to be weary of my life and yet afraid to die.  I Oh, how gladly I would have been anybody but myself, anything but a man, and in any condition but my own. There was nothing that did cross my mind more frequently than that it was impossible for me to be forgiven my transgression and be saved from the wrath to come.  (Tolstoy, Kierkegaard, Cioran)
A Few Sighs From Hell- “And again, had not God given such a discovery of the sad condition of those that are for the most part rich men, we should have had men concluded absolutely that the rich are the blessed men. Nay, albeit the Lord himself doth so evidently declare that the rich ones of the world are, for the most part, in the saddest condition, yet they, through unbelief, or else presumption, do harden themselves, and seek for the glory of this world...”
- “For, as I said before, it is evident, that they who live after the flesh in the lusts thereof, do not really and seriously think on death, and the judgment that doth follow after: neither do they indeed endeavour so to do; for did they, it would make them say with holy Job, 'All the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come' (Job 14:14).  And as I said before, that not only the wicked, but also the godly have their time to depart this life. And the beggar died. The saints of the Lord, they must be deprived of this life also, they must yield up the ghost into the hands of the Lord their God; they must also be separated from their wives, children, husbands, friends, goods, and all that they have in the world.”

1. Edgar Saltus
The Philosophy of Disenchantment

- On Leopardi: “He was not much over twenty before excessive study had well-nigh ruined such health as he once possessed. The slightest application was wearisome both to eye and brain. He wandered silently about the neighboring forests, seeking solitude not only for the sake of solitude, but also perhaps for the suggestions, at once soothing and rebellious, which solitude always whispers to him who courts her truly. At other times he sat hour by hour in a state as motionless as that of catalepsy. "I am so much overcome," he wrote to a friend, "by the nothingness that surrounds me, that I do not know how I have the strength to answer your letter. If at this moment I lost my reason, I think that my insanity would consist in sitting always with eyes fixed, open-mouthed, without laughing or weeping, or changing place. I have no longer the strength to form a desire, be it even for death."  (Kierkegaard, Cioran, Tillich about wanting to die but not being able to)
- “...the isolation which he partly made himself, and which was partly forced upon him, he watched the incubation of thought very much as another might have noted the progress of a disease. A life of this description, even at best, is hardly calculated to awaken much enthusiasm for every-day matters, and it was not long before Leopardi became not only heartily sick of the commonplace aspects of life, but contemptuous, too, of those who lived in broader and more active spheres.”
- "I study night and day, so long as my health permits; when it prevents me from working, I wait a month or so, and then begin again. As I am now totally different from that which I was, my plan of study has altered with me. Everything which savors of the pathetic or the eloquent wearies me beyond expression. I seek now only the true, the real, which before was so repulsive. I take pleasure in analyzing the misery of men and things, and in shivering as I note the sinister and terrible mystery of life. I see very clearly that when passion is once extinguished, there subsists in study no other source of pleasure save that of vain curiosity, whose satisfaction, however, is not without a certain charm."
- “His logic reduced itself to the paraphrase of an axiom, "I am, therefore I suffer," and the suffering which he experienced was not, he was very sure, limited solely to himself. It was, he considered, the garment and appanage of every sentient being. In this he was perfectly correct, but his error consisted in holding all cases to be equally intense, and in imagining that means might be devised which would at once do away with or, at least, lessen the evil.”
- “Leopardi at that time was in his twenty-seventh year, and the task to which he then devoted himself was, he said, to be the sad ending of a miserable life. His intention was to run the bitter truth to earth, to learn the obscure destinies of the mortal and the eternal, to discover the wherefore of creation, and the reason of man's burden of misery. "I wish," he said, "to dig to the root of nature and seek the aim of the mysterious universe, whose praises the sages sing, and before which I stand aghast."
- “Leopardi's philosophy is nothing if not destructive; he does not aim so much to edify as to undermine.” (Heisman)
- “Why, this is rubbish, look at modern institutions, look at progress, look at science; for if he listens to Leopardi he will learn that all these palpable advantages have, in expanding activity, only aggravated the misery of man.”
- “Finding himself, at last, face to face with Nature he took her to task, demanding what right she had to create him without his permission, and then, having done so, to leave him to his own devices?”
- “The Buddhist believes that the soul migrates until Nirvâna is attained, and that in the preparation for this state, which is the death of Death, the nothingness of a flame extinguished, there are four degrees. In the first, the novitiate learns to be implacable to himself, yet charitable and compassionate to others. He then acquires an understanding into the nature of all things, until he has suppressed every desire save that of attaining Nirvâna, when he passes initiate into the second degree, in which judgment ceases. In the next stage, the vague sentiment of satisfaction, which had been derived from intellectual perfection, is lost, and in the last, the confused consciousness of identity disappears.”
- “In brief, then, life to the Christian is a probation, to the Brahmin a burden, to the Buddhist a dream, and to the pessimist a nightmare.”
- “The so-called allurements and charms of the world are attractive to the vulgar, but not to the thinker, and whether the thinker be a Trappist or a comedian, he will, if called to account, express himself in a manner equally frank.” (comedians are today's philosophers)d
- “They are merely the resultants of the obvious and the true; they leap into being in every intelligent mind.” (me- recollection, revelation, involuntary, etc.)
- “In the world ye shall have tribulation," is the explicit warning of the Founder of Christianity, and to this warning all creeds, save that of the early Hellenists, concur. It did not, therefore, come from any religious teaching, nor, for that matter, from any philosophy. Still the impression, however vague it may seem when analyzed, has none the less been with him, as with all others, the reason being simply that he grew up with it as he may have grown up with fairy tales, and it is not until his aspirations stumble over facts that he begins to see that life, instead of being the pleasant land flowing with milk and honey, which he had imagined, is in reality something entirely different.”
- “...any man who has begun to dislike the propinquity of the average, and to feel that where the crowd find amusement there will be nothing but weariness and vexation of spirit for him. Under such circumstances he is an instinctive pessimist, and one who needs but little theoretic instruction to learn that he, as all others, has been made use of, and cheated to boot. The others, it is true, are, generally speaking, unaware of the deception that has been practiced on them; they have, it may be, a few faint suspicions that something has gone wrong somewhere, but even in uttermost depression the untutored look upon their misfortunes as purely individual, and unshared by the world at large.”  (Kierkegaard, Cioran, Vivekananda, the path is narrow)
- “There are those, too, who from dyspepsia, torpidity of the liver, or general crankiness of disposition, are inclined to take a gloomy view of all things; then there is a temperamental pessimism which displays itself in outbursts of indignation against the sorrows of life, and in frantic struggles with destiny and the meshes of personal existence; there is also the sullen pessimism of despair noticeable in the quiet folding of hands, and which with tearless eyes awaits death without complaint; then there are those who complain and sulk, who torment themselves and others, and who have neither the spunk to struggle nor the grace to be resigned,— this is the "forme miserable;" there is also a haphazard pessimism which comes of an unevenness of disposition, and which asserts itself on a rainy day, or when stocks are down; another is the accidental type, the man who, with loss of wife, child, or mistress, settles himself in a dreary misanthropy; finally, there is hypochondria, which belongs solely to pathology.  In none of these categories do the victims have any suspicion that a philosophical significance is attached to their suffering.”
- “Furthermore, as without brain there is no consciousness...” (Naturalism leads to descriptions of the Divinity of Nothing as Pessimistic)
- “To all this advanced pessimism has a ready answer: first, there can be no morality, for where there is no body and no property it is impossible to injure another; second, there can be no love, for every form of love, from the highest to the lowest, rests on the basis of sensibility; when, therefore, after the abstraction of shape, voice, features, and all bodily actions that are manifested through the medium of the brain, nothing but an unsubstantial shadow remains, what is there left to love? third, there can be no contemplation, for in a state of clairvoyance contemplation is certainly useless.” (me- this is also what Mystics say.  All the Earthly desires, emotions, etc. are worthless in the Eternal.  This passage also shows the breakdown of Human language when attempts to describe the Other put forth.  Nihiltheism)
- “From a religious standpoint advanced pessimism teaches that the misery of life is immedicable, and strips away every illusion with which it has been hitherto enveloped...” (Nihiltheism says this too.  Mystics say this too.)
- “For pessimism, while showing that each joy is an illusion, leaves pleasure where it found it, and simply incloses it in a black border, from which, in greater relief, it shines more brightly than before." Another objection which has been advanced against pessimism is that it is a creed of quietist inactivity.”
- “...denying that there is any finality even immanent in Nature, asserts that the order of phenomena is utterly illogical.” (me- a complete and utter denouncement of the Earthly.  No truth, no value, nothingness)
- “To sum up, then, what has gone before, the modern pessimist is a Buddhist who has strayed from the Orient, and who in his exodus has left behind him all his fantastic shackles, and has brought with him, together with ethical laws, only the cardinal tenet, "Life is evil." Broadly considered, the difference between the two creeds is not important. The Buddhist aspires to a universal nothingness...”
- “Happiness is an illusion.”
- “...whatever their private beliefs may be, they still wish their neighbors to think that they at least have no cause to complain. It is this desire to appear well in the eyes of others that makes what is termed the shabby-genteel, and which prevents so many proud yet vulgar minds from avowing their true position. Indeed, there are few who, save to an intimate, have the courage to acknowledge that they are miserable; there is at work within them the same instinct that compels the wounded animal to seek the depths of the bushes in which to die. People generally are ashamed of grief, and turn to hide a tear as the sensitive turn from an accident in the street, and veil their eyes from deformity. Moreover, it is largely customary to mock at the melancholy; and in good society it is an unwritten law that every one shall bring a certain quota of contentment and gayety, or else remain in chambered solitude.” (me- consequences of the death of God, there is to be no “problem”, since there is no solution.  Distractions, repression, denial, diversions, etc.)
- “Added to this, and beyond the insatiable desire to appear serene and successful in the eyes of others, there is the terrible dread of seeming to be cheated and outwitted of that which is apparently a universal birthright; and, according to a general conception, there is the same sort of moral baseness evidenced in an unuttered yet visible appeal for sympathy, as that which is at work in the beggar's outstretched palm. Many, it is true, there are who drop the furtive coin, but the world at large passes with averted stare. "There is work for all," is a common saying, and for the infirm there are hospitals and institutions; "What, then, is the use of giving?" it is queried, and the answer follows, "They who ask for alms are frauds." (me- is this a consequence of the death of God also? If so, then no wonder I feel so guilty. Talk to these people when they ask!)
- “...go to a well-nurtured and refined girl of eighteen and tell her that life is an affliction, and she will look upon her informant as a retailer of trumpery paradox. And at eighteen what a festival is life! To one splendid in beauty and rich in hope how magnificent it all seems; what unexplored yet inviting countries extend about the horizon! winter is a kiss that tingles, and summer a warm caress; everything, even to death, holds its promise. And then picture her as she will be at eighty, without an illusion left, and turning her tired eyes each way in search of rest.”
- “Illusion after illusion vanish into still air; to the intelligent, to the observer, and especially to him who is forced against his will to struggle in the van, life is an affliction, a mishap, a calamity, and sometimes a curse.”
- “When it does appear, it is, as a rule, presented by such thinkers as have been mentioned in the course of these pages, who, through their assertion of the undeniable awake the dislike and animosity of those who have not yet had their fill of proceedings in bankruptcy, and still hope to find life a pleasant thing well worth the living.” (me- God or Naturalism)
- “...the moral atmosphere of the present century is charged with three distinct disturbances,— the waning of religious belief, the insatiable demand for intense sensations, and the increasing number of those who live uncompanied, and walk abroad in solitude.”
- “What its final solution will be is, of course, uncertain. Schopenhauer recommended absolute chastity as the means to the great goal, and Hartmann has vaguely suggested a universal denial of the will to live; more recently, M. Renan has hazarded the supposition that in the advance of science some one might discover a force capable of blowing the planet to atoms, and which, if successfully handled, would, of course, annihilate pain. But these ideas, however practicable or impracticable they may be in the future, are for the moment merely theories; the world is not yet ripe for a supreme quietus, and in the mean time the worth of life may still be questioned.”
- “The phenomenon, Schopenhauer says, by which this change is marked is the transition from virtue to asceticism. In other words, it then no longer suffices for him to love others as himself; there arises within him a horror of the kernel and essence of the world, which recognizably is full of misery, and of which his own existence is an expression, and thereupon denying the nature that is in him, and ceasing to will anything, he gives himself up to complete indifferentism to all things. Such, in outline, is Schopenhauer's theory of ethics, which, starting from the principle of kindness of heart, leads to the renunciation of all things, and, curious as the denouement may appear, at last to universal deliverance.”
- “'It is this," Schopenhauer exclaims in his concluding paragraph, "that the Hindus have expressed in the empty terms of Nirvâna, and reabsorption in Brahma. We readily recognize that what remains after the entire abolition of the Will is without effect on those in whom it still works; but to those in whom it has been crushed, what is this world of ours with its suns and stellar systems? Nothing.'”
- “As a creed, the birthplace of pessimism is to be sought on the banks of the Ganges, or far back in the flower-lands of Nepaul, where the initiate, with every desire lulled, awaits Nirvâna, and murmurs only, "Life is evil."”
- “Now, as is well known, in every religion there is a certain metaphysical basis which is designed to supply an answer to man's first question; for while the animal lives in undismayed repose, man of all created things alone marvels at his own existence and at the destruction of his fellows. To his first question, then, What is life and death? each system attempts to offer a perfect reply; indeed, the temples, cathedrals, and pagodas clearly attest that man at all times and in all lands has continually demanded that some reply should be given, and it is perhaps for this very reason that where other beliefs have found fervent adherents, neither materialism nor skepticism have been ever able to acquire a durable influence. It is, however, curious to note that in attempting the answer, nearly every creed has given an unfavorable interpretation to life. Aside from the glorious lessons of Christianity, its teaching, in brief, is that the world is a vale of tears, that nothing here can yield any real satisfaction, and that happiness, which is not for mortals, is solely the recompense of the ransomed soul. To the Brahmin, while there is always the hope of absorption in the Universal Spirit, life meanwhile is a regrettable accident. But in Buddhism, which is perhaps the most naïve and yet the most sublime of all religions, and which through its very combination of simplicity and grandeur appeals to a larger number of adherents than any other, pessimism is the beginning, as it is the end.” (This says a lot)
- “He considered that, as a rule, a man is never in perfect harmony save with himself, for, he argued, however tenderly a friend or mistress may be beloved, there is at times some clash and discord. Perfect tranquillity, he said, is found only in solitude, and to be permanent only in absolute seclusion; and he insisted that the hermit, if intellectually rich, enjoys the happiest condition which this life can offer. The love of solitude, however, can hardly be said to exist in any one as a natural instinct; on the contrary, it may be regarded as an acquired taste, and one which must be developed in indirect progression. Schopenhauer...”
- (On Schopenhauer) “It was the rule of his life to expect nothing, desire as little as possible, and learn all he could, and as little was to be expected and nothing was to be learned from the majority of the dull ruffians who go to the making of the census, it is not to be wondered that he trod the thoroughfares of thought alone and dismissed the majority of men with a shrug. "They are," he said, "just what they seem to be, and that is the worst that can be said of them." Epigrams of this description were naturally not apt to increase his popularity. But for that he cared very little. He considered that no man can judge another save by the measure of his own understanding. Of course, if this understanding is of a low degree, the greatest intellectual gifts which another may possess convey to him no meaning; they are as colors to the blind; and consequently, in a great nature there will be noticed only those defects and weaknesses which are inseparable from every character.”
- “Schopenhauer's character was made up of that combination of seeming contradictions which is the peculiarity of all great men. He had the audacity of childhood and the timidity of genius. He was suspicious of every one, and ineffably kind-hearted. With stupidity in any form he was blunt, even to violence, and yet his manner and courtesy were such as is attributed to the gentlemen of the old school. If he was an egotist, he was also charitable to excess; and who shall say that charity is not the egotism of great natures? He was honesty itself, and yet thought every one wished to cheat him.”
- “"One thing is certain," said Schopenhauer, reflectively, "I am unworthy of my contemporaries, or they of me."”
- Voltaire's Pessimism: “To this conclusion the optimist will naturally object, but he does so in the face of history and experience, either of which is quite competent to prove that this world is far from being the best one possible. If neither of them succeeds in so doing, then let him wander through the hospitals, the cholera slums, the operating-rooms of the surgeon, the prisons, the torture-chambers, the slave-kennels, the battlefields, or any one of the numberless haunts of nameless misery; or, if all of these are too far, or too inconvenient, let him take a turn into one of the many factories where men and women, and even infants, work from ten to fourteen hours a day at mechanical labor, simply that they may continue to enjoy the exquisite delight of living.”
- “Briefly, then, life, to the pessimist, is a motiveless desire, a constant pain and continued struggle, followed by death, and so on, in secula seculorum, until the planet's crust crumbles to dust.” (the distinction between pessimism and Nihilism is definitely important.  Pessimism seems to be the attitude towards the experiences of Nihilism, not simply another word for Nihilism)
- “But here the question naturally arises, how is this annihilation to be accomplished? Through a vulgar and commonplace suicide? Not at all. Schopenhauer is far too logical to suggest a palliative so fruitless and clap-trap as that. For suicide, far from being a denial of the will to live, is one of its strongest affirmations. Paradoxical as it may seem, the man who takes his own life really wants to live; what he does not want are the misery and trials attendant on his particular existence. He abolishes the individual, but not the race. The species continues, and pain with it.” (Tolstoy, Kierkegaard, Cioran, 'wanting to die yet feeling bad about it/fearing Nothingness/not being able to')
- “In ancient philosophy, ethics was a treatise of happiness; in modern works, it is generally a doctrine of eternal salvation; to Schopenhauer, it is neither; for if happiness is unobtainable, the subject is necessarily untreatable from such a standpoint, and on the other hand, if morality is practiced in the hope of future reward, or from fear of future punishment, it can hardly be said to spring from any great purity of intention.”
- “On a higher level is he who, possessing a considerable income, uses but little of it for himself and gives the rest to the poor, the man who makes less distinction than is usually made between himself and others. Such an one is as little likely to let others starve while he himself has enough and to spare, as another would be to hunger one day that he might eat more the next. To a man of this description the veil of Mâyâ, which may be taken to mean the veil of illusions, has become transparent. He recognizes himself in every being, and consequently in the sufferer. Let this veil of Mâyâ be lifted from the eyes of a man to such an extent that he makes no distinction at all between himself and others, and is not only highly benevolent, but ready at all times to sacrifice himself for the common good; then he has in him the holiness of the saint and the germ that may flower into renunciation. The phenomenon, Schopenhauer says, by which this change is marked is the transition from virtue to asceticism. In other words, it then no longer suffices for him to love others as himself; there arises within him a horror of the kernel and essence of the world, which recognizably is full of misery, and of which his own existence is an expression, and thereupon denying the nature that is in him, and ceasing to will anything, he gives himself up to complete indifferentism to all things.  Such, in outline, is Schopenhauer's theory of ethics, which, starting from the principle of kindness of heart, leads to the renunciation of all things, and, curious as the dénouement may appear, at last to universal deliverance.”
- “...the awakening can only come with a recognition of the true nature of the dream. The work to be accomplished, therefore, is less physical than moral. We are not to strangle ourselves in sleep, but to rise out of it in meditation.” (non-movement, KOGWY)
- “The love of solitude, however, cannot be considered otherwise than as an acquired taste; it must come as the result of experience and reflection, and advance with the development of the intellect as well as with the progress of age. A child will cry with fright if it be left alone even for a moment; in boyhood, solitude is a severe penance; young men are eminently sociable, and it is only the more elevated among them who from time to time wander off by themselves; but even so, a day passed in strict seclusion is no easy matter. In middle age, it is not so difficult, while to the aged, solitude seems the natural element. But in each individual, separately considered, the growth of the inclination for solitude is always in proportion to the strength of the intellect, and, according to Schopenhauer, it is never thoroughly matured until the individual becomes firmly convinced that society is the most disagreeable of all the unpleasant things in the world.”
- “Chamfort says somewhere, very wittily, "It is sometimes said of a man that he lives alone and does not care for society; this is very much the same as saying that he does not care for exercise, because he does not make excursions at night in the forest of Bondy." (Ha!)
- “...every aspirant should accustom himself to carry a part of his solitude into society, and learn to be alone even in a crowd; in other words, not to tell others at once what he thinks, and not to pay much attention to what others may say; in this way he will in a measure keep himself unaffected by the stupidities which must necessarily surge about him, and harden himself to exterior influences.” (Karma Yoga, Kempis)
- “It is for this reason that when one wishes, or is obliged to live among his fellow-creatures, it becomes necessary to let each one work out his own nature and accept each individual as he stands; the most that can be done is to attempt to utilize the qualities and dispositions of each, so far as they may be adaptable, but in no case is a man to be condemned purely and simply for what he is.” (Jesus, non-judgment, Tolstoy, Vivekananda, Symbolism, religious pluralism)
- “In short, the creed as it stands is one of charity and good-will to all men; and, apart from its denial of future happiness, it does not in its ethics differ in any respect from the sublime teachings of the Christian faith.”

1. Timothy Leary

- “Admit it. You aren’t like them. You’re not even close. You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the “normal people” as they go about their automatic existences. For every time you say club passwords like “Have a nice day” and “Weather’s awful today, eh?”, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like “Tell me something that makes you cry” or “What do you think deja vu is for?”. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing? Who knows what you might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts. Do the unexpected. Find the others…”
- “You cannot stay "turned-on" all the time. You cannot stay any place all the time. That's a law of evolution. After the revelation it is necessary to drop-back-in, return to the fake-prop TV-studio and initiate small changes which reflect the glory and the meaning of the "turn-on".
- “For thousands of years the greatest artists, poets, philosophers, and lovers have used consciousness-expanding substances to turn-on tune-in drop-out. As part of the search for the meaning of life. As tools to reach new levels of awareness. To see beyond
the immediate social game. For revelation. For light in the darkness of the long voyage.”
- “Do you wish to use marijuana and LSD to get beyond the TV scenario? To enhance creativity? As catalysts to deepen wisdom? If so, you will be helped by making explicit the religious nature of your psychedelic activities.”
- “So write out your own language for the trip. "God" or "evolution", ''acid" or "sacrament", "guide" or "guru", "purgatorial redemption" or "bad trip", "mystic revelation" or ''goodigious  high''.  Say it naturally.” (importance of symbolism to describe the direct experience)
- “You select a myth as a reminder that you are part of an ancient and holy process. You select
a myth to guide you when you drop out of the narrow confines of the fake-prop studio-set.
Your mythic guide must be one who has solved the death-rebirth riddle. A  TV drama hero cannot help you. Caesar, Napoleon, Kennedy are no help to your cellular orientation. Christ, Lao Tse, Hermes Trismegistus, Socrates are recurrent turn-on figures.”
- “Unless you form your own new religion and devote an increasing amount of your energies to it,
you are (however exciting your personality TV role) a robot. Your new religion can be formed only by you.  Do not wait for a Messiah. Do it yourself. Now.”
- “The goals, roles, rules, rituals, values, language, space/ time locale, and mythic context of
your religion must be put on paper for two reasons. (make the journey clear and to deal with “Caesar”)
- “Everything that exists outside your body and your shrine belongs to Caesar. Caesar has constructed the fake-prop studio for his "king-of -the-mountain"game, and he can have it. Highways, property, status, power, money, weapons, all things, all external man-made objects belong to him. The spiritual life is completely detached from these props.”
- “Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality. To think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness; chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself.”
- “Did you imagine that there could be emotions in heaven? Emotions are closely tied to ego games. Check your emotions at the door to paradise.”

- “One night in long bygone times, man awoke and saw himself.  He saw that he was naked under cosmos, homeless in his own body. All things dissolved before his testing thought, wonder above wonder, horror above horror unfolded in his mind.”
- “Life had overshot its target, blowing itself apart.”
- “And now he can discern the outline of his biologicocosmic terms: He is the universe’s helpless captive, kept to fall into nameless possibilities.  From this moment on, he is in a state of relentless panic.  Such a ‘feeling of cosmic panic’ is pivotal to every human mind.”
- “In depressive states, the mind may be seen in the image of such an antler, in all its fantastic splendour pinning its bearer to the ground.”
- “Why, then, has mankind not long ago gone extinct during great epidemics of madness? Why do only a fairly minor number of individuals perish because they fail to endure the strain of living – because cognition gives them more than they can carry?”
- “Psychiatry even works on the assumption that the ‘healthy’ and viable is at one with the highest in personal terms. Depression, ‘fear of life,’ refusal of nourishment and so on are invariably taken as signs of a pathological state and treated thereafter. Often, however, such phenomena are messages from a deeper, more immediate sense of life, bitter fruits of a geniality of thought or feeling at the root of antibiological tendencies. It is not the soul being sick, but its protection failing, or else being rejected because it is experienced – correctly – as a betrayal of ego’s highest potential.”
- “In everyday interaction, isolation is manifested in a general code of mutual silence: primarily toward children, so these are not at once scared senseless by the life they have just begun, but retain their illusions until they can afford to lose them.”
- “The craving for material goods (power) is not so much due to the direct pleasures of wealth, as none can be seated on more than one chair or eat himself more than sated. Rather, the value of a fortune to life consists in the rich opportunities for anchoring and distraction offered to the owner.”
- “When a human being takes his life in depression, this is a natural death of spiritual causes. The modern barbarity of ‘saving’ the suicidal is based on a hair-raising misapprehension of the nature of existence.”
- “Only a limited part of humanity can make do with mere ‘changes’, whether in work, social life, or entertainment. The cultured person demands connections, lines, a progression in the changes. Nothing finite satisfies at length, one is ever proceeding, gathering knowledge, making a career. The phenomenon is known as ‘yearning’ or ‘transcendental tendency.’...Any grounds for 'progressive optimism' are removed by this major psychological law.”
- “And if we use the word in a religious sense, only the latter description fits. For here, none has yet been clear about what he is longing for, but one has always a heartfelt awareness of what one is longing away from, namely the earthly vale of tears, one’s own inendurable condition. If awareness of this predicament is the deepest stratum of the soul, as argued above, then it is also understandable why the religious yearning is felt and experienced as fundamental.”
- “Is it possible for ‘primitive natures’ to renounce these cramps and cavorts and live in harmony with themselves in the serene bliss of labour and love? Insofar as they may be considered human at all, I think the answer must be no.” (Infinite/finite gap, selflessness seemingly impossible, the existential philosopher different than the mystic, meaninglessness more overwhelming than mystical experience)
- “he absence of naturally (biologically) based spiritual activity shows up, for example, in the pervasive recourse to distraction (entertainment, sport, radio – ‘the rhythm of the times’). Terms for anchoring are not as favourable – all the inherited, collective systems of anchorings are punctured by criticism, and anxiety, disgust, confusion, despair leak in through the rifts (‘corpses in the cargo.’)”
- “If we continue these considerations to the bitter end, then the conclusion is not in doubt. As long as humankind recklessly proceeds in the fateful delusion of being biologically fated for triumph, nothing essential will change.”

1. Mitchell Heisman

- “The following is an experiment in nihilism. Already I have contradicted myself! How can one believe in disbelief? I might be a nihilist except that I don’t believe in anything.  If there is no extant God and no extant gods, no good and no evil, no right and no wrong, no meaning and no purpose; if there are no values that are inherently valuable; no justice that is ultimately justifiable; no reasoning that is fundamentally rational, then there is no sane way to choose
between science, religion, racism, philosophy, nationalism, art, conservatism, nihilism, liberalism, surrealism, fascism, asceticism, egalitarianism, subjectivism, elitism, ismism.”
- “If reason is incapable of deducing ultimate, nonarbitrary human ends, and nothing can be judged as ultimately more important than anything else, then freedom is equal to slavery; cruelty is equal to kindness; love is equal to hate; war is equal to peace; dignity is equal to contempt;
destruction is equal to creation; life is equal to death and death is equal to life.”
- “...the most important question is whether there is an important question. The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.”
- “Can one live a philosophy of the nihilistic, reconciling meaninglessness with every thought and emotion at every moment? If active unbelief were the highest organizing principle of a life, would the consequence be rational self-destruction? Could suicide represent the pinnacle of the rational life realized?” (Vivekananda says a Rationalist must be ready to follow reason to its farthest conclusion, e.g. the self is an illusion, most atheists, and even theists, say they are 'following reason', but they aren't, most end up with worldly conclusions which do not go far enough, the end is the self-negation of the self, in order to embrace or attempt to recognize the True Self)
- “Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.”
- “Nihilism could be interpreted as the inherent paradox of living a belief in disbelief. So called “nihilism”, however, is more unbelief than belief in disbelief. Unbelief is a condition reached through negation. It is not a positive expression of belief in disbelief, but rather, the negative cumulative result of refuting and recognizing the groundlessness of any and every instance of belief encountered thus far: lack of justification for belief in the authority of the state, lack of
justification for belief in the authority of one’s instincts and emotions, and, lack of justification for belief that God exists.” (the seeming difference between Nihilism and skepticism)
- “Willing death is, then, an attempt to live a nihilistic life.”
- “If no values are inherently valuable, then life has no inherent value. If life has no inherent purpose, then its end could be directed towards its negation or death. Death could be posited as the highest value. Since the other secular values are premised upon life, death is the test of all the
others. To test life with death tests the most important question I can conceive of: whether there is an important question.”
- “The implications of life’s meaninglessness have not been elicited with sufficient ruthlessness. My methodology is honesty to the point of absurdity; honesty without mercy; honesty unprejudiced by morals, aesthetics, faith, or hope. When all illusions have been dispelled, at the end of overcoming subjectivities, biases, and prejudices towards life, one encounters the possibility of rational negation of self-interest; rational self-annihilation; rational self-destruction. The experiment in nihilism is to seek out precisely those truths that are most deadly and destructive to me. To will death through truth and truth through death.”
- “When all choices are equal, equality is compatible with total randomness. If all choices are equal, then the choice of death is equal to the choice of life. If life is meaningless, then God
is nothing.  But a funny thing happened on the way to nihilistic self-destruction. It was precisely through radical disbelief that I discovered an evolutionary basis for God.  Most secular people in the West are simply not ruthless enough in their nihilism to vivisect belief to death. Yet vivisecting belief to death exposes how the original monotheistic conception of God likely arose out of ruthless realism. Monotheism may have originated out of a skeptical, nihilistic, materialistic
objectivity that annihilated the biologically based subjectivity of the self, and thus created something ‘out of nothing’.  (maybe God doesn't 'originate' with Nihilism, but can be 'found' through Nihilism)  WOW- look how “far back” my thoughts were; not long ago at all, maybe a few months)
- “The attempt to be consistently materialistic yielded the tentative conclusion that the attempt to be consistently materialistic is rational self-destruction.”
- “Perhaps the whole experiment in nihilism is a failure simply because I somehow managed to make it too meaningful.”
- “Nihilism turns out to be more paradoxical than I first thought. The Singularity does not refute nihilism, but rather, “God” may be technological nihilism — yet only in the same sense in which a human being is technological nihilism as a gene replicating machine.”
- “My formula for self-destruction is truth seeking.  Doing so diverts me away from a normal path, the biological path or the path of life, and the entire mythological cave of human relationships.”
- “Psychological explanations can be used, not only to evade the nihilistic, but to evade the scientific equation of the larger material world with a material view of one’s own mind — and thus to misunderstand the problem.”
- “When I say that I do not believe in my emotions, I don’t meant that I don’t have them; I mean that I do not accord them any ultimate meaning or significance. Darwin’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals demonstrates why: emotions and instincts are the product of
evolutionary adaptations that happened to be adaptive for generations of ancestors. I do not
believe in my emotions, however much I continue to be driven by them. This, on a human level, this is what nihilism or unbelief means. On the most plain, down to earth and human level, this is really where the entire “experiment in nihilism” arose. The experiment in nihilism is really only
the consequence or extension of this original experiment on myself. After exploring an unadulterated materialistic view, life lost its cogency for me.”
- “The experiment in nihilism is a test of what I really do or do not believe. If it is the case that emotions are former genetic adaptations or illusions of an evolutionary inheritance, the chance products of a particular course of natural selection, then there is no reason to assume that they
are guides beyond their original adaptive functions. This also means that everyone else and their emotions are also treatable as physical material.”
- “Self-consistent materialism leads to interpreting every subjective experience, i.e. fear, love, inspiration, dreams, etc., as physical matter.”
- “If humans are emotion machines, then music must work, in some sense, like a machine.
Music could be a form of emotional technology to control my own behavior intelligently. In other words, if emotions are the products of material processes, then art could be viewed as a form of
technology. From the standpoint of this musical materialism, as one of the most extreme implications of an unadulterated materialism, lay a possible solution to dominance of my own
analytic and objective tendency to materialize everything. I began to listen to music, especially German music (and especially Wagner and Bach), as a form of technology to counter my own tendencies to view everything as material or technology.”
- “Bach is ground from outside of myself that makes up for the nihilistic lack of ground within myself. Bach counters my material self-consistency and its tendency towards self-decomposition
with a form of holistic-mind order.”
- “It is a fundamental hypothesis of this work that, not indifference, but an active blind spot to certain kinds of “truth”, certain kinds of objectivity, is the condition of biological human life. Martin Heidegger is what happens when one believes in one’s own emotions, i.e. poetry.”
- “If life is truly meaningless and there is no rational basis for choosing among fundamental
alternatives, then all choices are equal and there is no fundamental ground for choosing life over death.”
- “Liberals are not at all fully nihilistic. In part, there is the practical belief in values vaguely corresponding to human rights. But more fundamentally, “secularists” implicitly
believe in a religion of the common emotions. They generally believe that meaning is to be found in the material, biochemical processes that humans experience as emotions.”
- “Were Nietzsche and the Athenians right about Socrates? Reason appears unable to determine values and, therefore, the entire Western pretension to rationalism is a kind of joke.  And even worse, it’s not even a good joke.”
- “From a Darwinistic view, every capacity for emotion evolved as a product of genetic adaptation. Emotions, then, are biochemical-based illusions that evolved to propagate genes. Pleasure, happiness, emotions, and desire: these are the evolutionary tricks that promoted the survival of our ancestors. The “happiness” and “sadness” of present day humans are the genetically adaptations of generations of ancestors.  This is “happiness”, the great goal of humanity has been striving for: a particular configuration of biochemical reactions.” (Ha!)
- “For some, the meaninglessness gleaned from a scientific view of life leads to nausea, angst, and nihilistic despair. I reject this attitude on the grounds that nausea, angst, and nihilistic despair also originate in material reactions in the brain. What does despair mean to someone who interprets that emotion as a chemical reaction in the brain? The process of disillusionment can also be disillusioned and de-aestheticized.”
- “What is closest to total indifference is to be dead. If an observer hypothesizes death then, from that perspective, the observer has no vested interests in life and thus possible grounds for
the most objective view. The more an observer is reduced to nothing, the more the observer is no longer a factor, the more the observer might set the conditions for the most rigorous objectivity.” (selflessness)
- “It is likely that most people will not even consider the veracity of this correlation between death and objectivity even if they understand it intellectually because most will consciously or unconsciously choose to place the interests of self-preservation over the interests of objectivity. In other words, to even consider the validity of this view assumes that one is willing and able to even consider prioritizing objectivity over one’s own self-preservation. Since it not safe to simply assume this on an individual level, let alone a social level, relatively few are willing and able to seriously address this issue (and majority consensus can be expected to dismiss the issue). In short, for most people, including most “scientists”, overcoming self-preservation is not ultimately a subject for rational debate and objective discussion.” (the path is narrow, most people are not philosophers, Taoism and the supremacy of direct experience)
- “I cannot fully reconcile my understanding of the world with my existence in it.”
- “To pursue science, scientists must be justified by something that, strictly speaking, is not science itself, i.e. curiosity, wonder, faith in science, the will to master all knowledge, belief that
it will benefit the world, belief in pure knowledge for its own sake, or some other breach of objectivity. Because science, apparently, cannot consistently justify itself, something else must if it is to exist at all.”
- “The attempt to eliminate all subjective bias would culminate in the elimination of science, for science has failed to produce evidence that it is capable of fully justifying itself.  The very existence of science is the strongest evidence that scientists are less than fully objective. An attempted self-consistent objectivity is a self-destructing objectivity, since the bias of the subjective belief in the value of objectivity must be removed to be objective. This implies that an
objective “theory of all” could not account for itself.”
- “How, then, does a scientist choose a subject to study? Is there a way to objectively determine what the subject of objectivity should be? Is there a fundamentally objective reason for choosing the study of archaeology over the study of chemistry? Is the decision to study Sanskrit over Chinese more rational than the decision to worship Allah over not worshiping Allah? Is there a fundamentally rational ground for making one choice over another?”
- “Even once one has decided on some facet of reality, there is still the problem of interpretation. Consider the interpretation that my interpretation is just a way of throwing order upon the chaos of the world. Is this interpretation itself a just a way of throwing order on the chaos of the world? Even the word “chaos” imposes a kind of order over (things), which cannot (?) be put into (words).  In any case, if objectivity cannot justify itself then objectivity is subjective in the sense of being selective; one must always determine what the dominant factors are; what is important; the value of facts.  Some facts are valued at the expense of others. Some things are selected for study, while others are neglected or demoted. I can find no definitive, objective way to choose one subject or field of inquiry over another. Why am I even reflecting on this problem right now
at the expense of some other problem? This work thus appears, by definition, subjective, in that I chose certain domains as subjects of objectivity at the expense of others. How, then, can I justify the subjects I “choose” to be objective about?”
- “If I had no biases I would be dead, rather that sitting here right now, writing about them.” (this is towards the end of the letter.  The misspellings and poorly structured sentence says a lot in a 'strange/poor' way. It's almost as if he is 'cracking')
- “By simply changing my values from life values to death values, and setting my trajectory for rational biological self-destruction, I am able to liberate myself from many of the biases that
dominate the horizons of most people’s lives.”  (I feel Mckenna might say this in a more 'optimistic' fashion)
- “This means, however, that for the average Westerner who plays the basic ‘Euclidean’ rules of the liberal democratic system, my ‘non-Euclidean’ logic will likely appear to be “irrational”. It may appear repugnant to the “nature” of individual self-preservation.  Yet if my theory is nearly
universally condemned, does this mean that I do not have a valid point or does it mean
that other observers are not willing to prioritize objectivity over the bias of self-preservation?” (jean amery speaks of the 'logic of life' and the 'logic of death' which is why he thinks that most psychological theories have 'some truth' to them, but they all hinge of an unjustified preference for life)
- “My objective is to kill myself. Now how can I explain this? If reason cannot determine ultimate values, then how do I explain the facts of my values?  I can begin to explain myself through the Nietzschean distinction between truth and life. It is a modern delusion to believe that pursuit of truth has any necessary correspondence with life-affirming values. To not gloss over the forks between these paths with myths and compromises, but to confront them openly, directly, and as far as possible, without illusion, can lead to the path of truth and death.”
- “Yet if Gödel is right, then it may be that to understand yourself is to understand that you can
never fully understand yourself.”
- “The attempt to fully include one’s self in one’s own theory can never, it seems, be achieved. However, the attempt to approach this state amounts to a process of rational self-destruction because, in order to approach objectivity, the elimination of subjectivity must proceed, and the elimination of all self-interest approaches the elimination of biases of life over death. Rational self-destruction that culminates in death is correlated with the most thorough attempt at
scientific objectivity: the attempt to include one’s self in one’s own scientific Weltanschauung. The impossible goal of self-consistent objectivity nonetheless approaches a definition of suicide or death through the attempt at the consistent elimination of biases towards life.”
- “I cannot synthesize this work with my living, sociobiological existence. I cannot live with the implications of my work and this leaves the possibility of separating the interests of truth and life.” (this is an almost 'sad/desperate' paragraph coming from someone who is cracking under the pressure of existence, of being. Nihilism, or naturalism vs theism, material vs non-temporal are seemingly irreconcilible, which leads to what Heisman refers to as 'rational self-destruction)
- “The literal act of killing myself is a literal act of willing the progress of equality — the equality of the biological and the physical — by overcoming biological boundaries that preserve biology “above” the larger physical environment.  Biological life or biological self-preservation, in other words, has no superior status to any other form of matter.  This work embodies acts that rationally and systematically deprive my life of the conditions of its own self-preservation. Rational self-destruction is posited here as the actualization of an experiment to test a tentative
nihilism.”
- “Just as life is a process, the undoing of life is also a process or “progress”. My writings are daily affirmations of death. I am painting myself into a corner until there is only one inevitable act left. I am killing every belief and breaking down every value that upholds my very life until what is left
is nothing. An experiment in nihilism, I am destroying all values that uphold life until I am left with nowhere to stand.” (this is renunciation, this is what I am doing)
- “When all choices are equal, equality is compatible with total randomness. If all choices are equal, then the choice of death is equal to the choice of life. If life is meaningless, then God is nothing. (this is above, but important enough to stand out as a repeat)
- “When my father died when I was twelve, I dealt with his death by interpreting him as a purely material phenomenon.   In other words, I viewed my father as a material thing and his death as a material process. Well before my father died, I had interpreted my own emotions as material processes and my reaction to my father’s death was treated no differently.  If I treat myself and understand myself by the standard of physical materialism, there is no reason why I should not do the same to others who, by the same Darwinistic understanding of life, are also physical material.”
- “From a materialist, Darwinist standpoint, I and every other human is an animal and a
material object. All emotions, whether joy or misery, elation or depression, are rooted in behavior that proved to be genetically adaptive for animal ancestors.”  (this is not a piece of apologetics from an evangelical christian, this is a dude who held to this, experienced this materialist worldview, and killed himself from it)
- “The distinction between the desire to know and the will to know is key here. The desire to know, motivated only by curiosity or pleasure, tends to be selective. The desire to know tends to ignore, repress, or otherwise not confront what is not conducive to pleasure or happiness. The will to
know is confrontation with all as it comes in life and a seeking out of the least pleasurable and the least joyous truths. This distinction is imperative here because I interpreted happiness, pleasure,
and joy itself as “material”, as the product of physical processes, and strove to overcome
submission to their biasing influence.”  (how is this any different than Vivekananda or Kierkegaard in his will one thing?)
- “The decisive turn that made me different, or consummated my self-destructive difference from others, was really this experiment on myself where I systematically interpreted all subjective experience: emotions, experiences, intuitions, instincts as physical material; not better or worse
than any other physical material. This experiment, in its conception, amounts to a definition of disillusionment.  Originally, the procedure was built on a radical selfishness— not belief in selfishness, but a tentative-programmatic one based on the tentative assumption that no premise is
fundamentally justified.”  (fuck, this Naturalism is 'disillusionment', agreed)
- “Emotions are the root of beliefs.  To destroy all beliefs, all belief in emotion must be destroyed.
After systematically interpreting my emotions are material processes for at least a year and a half, the cause of life simply lost its cogency.”
- “Disillusioned of belief in my own subjective experiences, at rock bottom, I turned to completely destroy myself.  If life itself is without ultimate meaning, and is not fundamentally
rationally superior to death, then perhaps the test of the worth of life is found in willing death and self-destruction.”
-”Instead of attempting to overcoming my socially self-destructive tendencies, I gave them free reign.  Instead of doing what strengthening, I do what is weakening. Instead of doing what is considered socially acceptable, I do what is considered humiliating. These little self-destructions help feed the larger ones. Yet, at the same time, it means in at least some respects, it means I
pay my rent and work out to keep myself physically fit, so I am in a position to achieve the most rational and most comprehensive self-negation.” (fuck, this is me)
- “So what, then, are the psychological characteristics of such a person who engages in such self-destructive behavior? Whatever the psychological quirks I might possess, my central problem is nihilism. Can the meaninglessness of existence be cured with therapy? Lie therapy, whether religious or secular, is overwhelmingly the normative state of the human race. Put another way, there may be sound psychological reasons why radical nihilism is not a condition prescribed by therapists. Yet if psychologists are scientists, and their own methodology confirms the scientific view of human beings as material things in motion, on what grounds can they criticize nihilism in itself? Only insofar as psychologists are not scientists; insofar as they are non-objective partisans of the ‘life party’ are psychologists fundamentally and irrevocably biased against consideration
of my point of view. Psychological explanations can be used, not only to evade the nihilistic, but to evade the scientific equation of the larger material world with a material view of one’s own mind — and thus to misunderstand the problem.” (the idea of 'mental illness' not being what it is normally defined as.  Tillich makes this distinction, as does Becker, e.g. what could psychotherapy possibly say to the Nihilist?  Nihilism is seeing the world correctly, happiness is for the pigs, Zapffe all say this)
- “I have become disenchanted and have lost spontaneous naivety to an extent that all efforts to
regain the cause of life ring hollow and fall flat.”
- “You must in some sense believe the subjective state of fear, and not anticipate and out-compete it with an objective, physical-material reduction, in order to take it seriously.”
- “The most consistent physicalism, a physicalism that makes no exceptions whatsoever for subjective experiences such as instincts, intuitions, and emotions, leads to rational self-destruction or rational death.  Self-consistent materialism leads to interpreting every subjective experience, i.e. fear, love, inspiration, dreams, etc., as physical matter.” (again, this is not an evangelical christian speaking, this is the consequences of a Naturalistic worldview)
- “My formula for self-destruction is truth seeking.”
- “...I ultimately concluded that unadulterated material objectivity was probably the most basic source of the problem itself...This meant that I could take myself apart in some ways, but I could not put myself back together.”
- “If life is truly meaningless and there is no rational basis for choosing among fundamental
alternatives, then all choices are equal and there is no fundamental ground for choosing life over death. Yet since I do not believe in nihilism, why not test “nihilism”? Perhaps I am wrong, but if
the question of whether there is an important question is the most important question, then testing this question is closest thing to importance. Since counterarguments almost always
take their starting point with a bias towards existence, to criticize this bias is to take a starting that is open to the possibility of death.” (Amery)
- “Every word, every thought, and every emotion come back to one core problem: life is
meaningless. The experiment in nihilism is to seek out and expose every illusion and every myth, wherever it may lead, no matter what, even if it kills us.”
- “Who is to say that a life of a saint, an artist, or a philosopher is superior to a life sniffing glue.”
- “To engage in human relationships is to dwell within a mythological world.”
- “While one may feel compassion, does this mean that one lacks the capacity to discipline one’s self from being mastered by that impulse. That people are mastered by such impulses is only another confirmation of Darwin’s insight that humans are animals. Most humans are driven
overwhelmingly by instinct and emotion.”
- “If reason cannot determine fundamental values, then reason can be used to justify literally anything.”
- “Nihilism, noted Friedrich Nietzsche, “represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals”.  This is the bankrupt, philosophical disaster area the West dwells in. I see no “bottom”, no limits to stop the freefall into value nothingness.  Implicit in nihilism is the
collapse of the entire human cause. The ultimate logical conclusion of Western values is the rational self-destruction of the West.  Is this absurd? If this is absurd then it must also be absurd
that I rage at the entire cosmos for having no ultimate meaning. But there is no reason to be pessimistic. There is no justification whatsoever for a negative attitude! There is no justification whatsoever for a positive attitude! There is no justification whatsoever for a neutral attitude!”
