1: <h1><strong>The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing</strong></h1><h2><strong><em>-The Dialectical Silence-</em></strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>“There is a nagging suspicion that the diagnostics are exploiting Heidegger’s exotic language in order to “keep talking,” and thus keep calm and unaffected by the horror of the bottomless abyssus humanae conscientiae with which they are incessantly confronted.” Tønnessen</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Martin Heidegger is what happens when one believes in one’s own emotions, i.e. poetry.” Heisman</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“I know that I must either find a way to move beyond the theistic patterns of the past in search for a new way to speak of and to engage the ultimate reality that I call God, or be honest about living in a godless world.” Spong</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question comes up once more: Is one driven to madness or forced to relinquish their existence? Can one confront the Other in an authentic way that is not motivated by a purely selfish need for comfort or ‘security’ within the nightmare of existence that is revealed through the experience of Nihilism? Can a language of Nihilism, having the duel roles of navigating the Nothing of the world while propagating a loop Transcendental aspect of meaninglessness, as an authentic way to encounter the Other, be developed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is there any place for philosophical thinking in this world of contradictions?&nbsp;These questions plague modern philosophy, encompassing more than just the symbolic reasoning behind concepts of God and understandings of Nihilism. The suggestion of a language dedicated to Nihilism, as Transcendent, raises the prospect of a collective acknowledgment of the deeply discomforting idea of a fundamentally meaningless reality – an acknowledgment we have been avoiding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can the human mind, in its state of evolutionary distress to find meaning, to survive and adapt, ever truly accept such a vast, terrifying void, laid bare in front of its understanding? Could we actualize an existentialist form of survival, surpassing historical and cultural scaffoldings imposed on the consciousness to cope with the underlying Nothing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thought naturally incites resistance. After all, humanity’s journey has always, whether an explicit battle or with a feigning aloofness, been the attempts to eliminate this Nothingness. How does one "eliminate" Nothing? And the more pressing question: <em>Should</em> one even attempt to alleviate the Nothing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, this existentially ‘possible’ Being-towards-death remains, from the existential point of view, a fantastical exaction…Does Dasein ever factically throw itself into such a Being-towards-death? Does Dasein demand, even by reason of its own-most Being, an authentic potentiality-for-Being determined by anticipation?” Heidegger</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One must first accept that one does not know what they are talking about. This is simply another crewd translation of the simple fact that there is not one person who knows what is ‘going on here’.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Underhill expresses, fully, the self-criticism that this sort of project is bound to: “If the metaphysician be true to his own postulates, he must acknowledge in the end that we are all forced to live, to think, and at last to die, in an unknown and unknowable world: fed arbitrarily and diligently, yet how we know not, by ideas and suggestions whose truth we cannot test but whose pressure we cannot resist.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Could we circumnavigate all this and express the experience of Nihilism in the simplest of terms as: ‘all worldly endeavors are futile’. It seems that we cannot. Cliches, as such, will never do, since, as Heidegger points out, cliches are nothing but a form of empty ‘idle talk’ riddled with ‘ambiguity’ of a passing off as ‘knowing’. This ‘passing over’ is simply another distraction. There may be a ‘message’ that is missed when we speak of Nihilism in such cursory ways. If we want to develop a language of Nihilism that is not simply Naturalistic, that is beyond the dead ‘solutions’ of the worldly philosophies and religions, and moreover, that is not simply idle-talk that contributes nothing more than to a premature suicide, then we must proceed past such banalities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A main problem with discussing Nihilism is that there are no words that hold a tight enough grasp on the experience itself as to allow the experience to become transferable. St. Therese of Lisieux explains her experience within a Christian structure: “He allowed my soul to be overwhelmed with darkness, and the thought of Heaven, which had consoled me from my earliest childhood, now became a subject of conflict and torture…I wish I could express what I feel, but it is beyond me. One must have passed through this dark tunnel to understand its blackness.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is one who has experienced Nihilism, with its essence of ‘non-transferability’, now left to a Quietist silence? I believe that an honest answer to this question is: yes. Do we stop here? We cannot, because we are still in the theoretical. Most, of the seemingly rare few, who have experienced Nihilism do not have the ‘stamina’ to renounce the world in its entirety. Experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not equivalent (as we spoke of in the section on Naturalism). Beyond renunciation, even the Suicide, who claims to feel a ‘brand’ of Nihilism, is seemingly misunderstanding the message. The Nihilist is one who uses suicide, rather than commits it; at least for a particular span of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is there then some type of ‘affirmative’ substance that is found within the experience of Nihilism that allows us to move forward in a task of developing a language that breaks through what could otherwise be perceived as a simple pointing out, or culmination, of the ‘world’s sufferings’?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To quote Cioran once more on the ’ affirmative substance’ of Nothing: “The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A language of Nihilism reflects the need to confront the Transcendental yearning as a true confrontation, rather than something that one tries to replace with this or that 'thing', this or that creed, this or that activity, etc. The need for such a language in demonstrated in the words of Huxley:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“…the ultimate Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended, except by those who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit. This being so, it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the experience of nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so little conviction. This kind of empirical theology is on precisely the same footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience of naked-eye observers.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A ‘new language’ of Nihilism is one that must be worked out in order to provide an adequate account, that allows for the possibility of Transcendence, as revealed through Nihilism, within human experience, without specifically holding to either a purely ‘religious’ or ‘naturalist’ worldview. With great reservation, I suggest the use of the word Nihiltheism as a word to ground this ‘genre’ of human experience. This is a language that is not strictly based upon on myth, tradition, nor empirical facts. This language must also not ever be taken as ‘complete’ (‘complete’ in a similar way in which ‘literal’ would be used with regards to interpreting a mythical language), but rather as a symbolic language which is always self-critical and therefore always open for re-interpretation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A language, as any other, may be able to be developed in order to ‘navigate’ the ‘complexities’ of Nihilism in both its forms, as the Nothing of the world and its Transcendence. The groundwork for a language of Nihilism, at least up till the present moment, is found in its most ‘complete’ form in Heidegger’s comprehensive language about the human condition described in Being and Time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Within the ‘already-made’ language of Heidegger we have concepts of anxiety, moments of vision, everydayness, the call of conscience, the situation, authenticity, uncanniness, resoluteness, and so on, already laid out and defined, that capture key insights into the human condition. These insights and concepts allow for an interpretation of the Nihilistic experience on ‘non-naturalistic’ terms while still being grounded within the naturalistic aspect of the human condition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no need to get bogged down with Heidegger’s perspective being essentially ‘atheistic’ or ’ theistic’ in itself, since we are specifically looking to interpret and discover a language in which a Nihilist may speak about the human situation as he experiences it. Heidegger himself attempts to avoid such presumptuous terms as ‘atheistic’ or ‘theistic’ as they are taken to be ultimately restrictive for a full analysis of the human situation. What Heidegger speaks of ‘objectively’ must still be experienced subjectively. Therefore, Heidegger’s analysis may only be seen as an introductory ‘map’ with regards to speaking about the Other. This ‘map’ need not guarantee a ‘direct’ path to the Other. In other words, assuming there can be such a thing as a ‘language of Nihilism’, the possible interpretations may vary immensely. This ‘Other’ is an aspect of the developing language that will have to rest in obscurity, not only in these introductory words, but even within a more developed speech-set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without the need, yet, to go into detail concerning all of Heidegger’s terms or concepts, a bare-bones laying out of the basic structure may be put down in order to help envision the coherency of Heidegger’s analysis of human existence as a possible foundation for developing a language of Nihilism. Therefore, a very brief summary of what Heidegger refers to as ‘Being-Towards-Death’ with some of its particularities will be put forth as an example of the foundations of such a language.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>‘Being-Towards-Death’, concisely put, consist of anxiety, in a moment of vision, having a call of conscience that seems to come ‘from me and beyond me’ (Buber- “It appears simultaneously as acting on and as acted upon”), that ‘gives something to be understood’ in an ‘indefinite’, incommunicable way, and which causes the world to ‘drop out’ as to the entirety of existence sinks into insignificance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, one feels a “push” to stay resolute, sitting in this anxiety produced experience, while knowing that death may happen at any moment, which, as a result, allows one to escape the ‘everydayness’ of the world in order to turn inward with attempts to discover one’s True-Self. Without even going into detail, Heidegger’s structure is one which should not be difficult to see how his analysis of the human condition explicitly lends itself to the building of a Nihilistic language.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is Heidegger’s analysis, which is commonly labeled as ‘atheistic’, really at all different from what the Trappist monk, Thomas Merton, has come to accept? Merton also clearly states the bankruptcy of a constant outward-seeking, hectic search for ‘meaning’ within life. In comparison to Heidegger, he express the same idea in this language: “The truly sacred attitude toward life is in no sense an escape from the sense of nothingness that assails us when we are left alone with ourselves. On the contrary, it penetrates into that darkness and that nothingness, realizing that the mercy of God has transformed our nothingness into His temple and believing that in our darkness His light has hidden itself. Hence the sacred attitude is one which does not recoil from our own inner emptiness, but rather penetrates it with awe and reverence, and with the awareness of mystery. This is a most important discovery in, the interior life.” Is the use of the word ‘God’ enough to somehow make any sort of distinction between Heidegger’s ‘atheism’ (which he explicitly denies) and Merton’s ‘theism’? A Nihilistic language would be one that attempts to reconcile such superficial disparities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, Heidegger admits that his full conception of ‘Being-Towards-Death’ is one that is ‘fantastical’. That is to say, if we are to develop past a purely Heideggarian analysis of Being, how does one, in fact, proceed in a constant participation with an existence that is drowned in the meaninglessness of the world (this includes one's self, that paradoxically, though reasonably, due to our nature of doubled-mindedness, is washed over with fear and doubt, paralyzed at the thought of their nothing selves disappearing into infinity {this is just a thought that needs rewritting}) and which faces annihilation at any moment? Is it possible to even proceed with, or in, such a ‘fantastical’ structure?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Further, what is to be meant by a ‘True-Self’ as interpreted on not ‘wholly naturalistic’ terms which avoids, in its analysis of the human condition, from falling back into the language of myth and worldly ‘religion’? On the other hand, is there any kind of ‘positive’ substance that stems from the Nihilistic experience which is not to be interpreted as wholly biological, naturalistic, and worldly, as many interpreters of Heidegger have, so far, done with his language? Heidegger himself dismisses both ‘biological’ explanations and, seemingly traditional conceptions of ‘God’ as too preemptive, as they are hindered by assumptions that do not necessarily leave open the mystery of the ‘Why?’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“The onotological analysis of conscience on which we are thus embarking, is prior to any description and classification of Experiences of conscience, and likewise lies outsuide any biological ‘explination’ of this phenomenon. But it is also no less distant from a theological exigesis of conscience or any employment of this phenomenon for proofs of God or for establishing an ‘immediate’ conscience of God.” (pg. 313)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(‘The Call’ as both from oneself and beyond oneself) “If the interpretation continues in this direction, one supplies a possesor for the power thus posited, or one takes the power itself as a person who makes himself known- namely God. On the other hand one may try to reject this explination in which the caller is taken as an alien manifestation of such a power, and to explain away the conscience ‘biologically’ at the same time. Both these sexplinations pass over the phenomenal findings too hastly.” (pg. 320)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This new language must not be seen as ‘rescuing’ one from the Nothingness, rather it is a language that attempts to bring one ‘face to face’ with the nightmare of existence. The terror of existence is one that opens up the ‘positive’ content. The unending questioning of ‘why?’ opens up something that is not wholly natural, yet must still be experienced and discussed within the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even the mystical experience, while a blow to Naturalism, does not defeat Naturalism. One of the few accurate statements that Sartre put forth when describing his particular brand of ‘existentialism’ was that whether God exists or not, it’s all still the same, it makes no difference (regardless if he was using this statement as a ‘defense’ of his atheistic existentialism). The ultimately empty structure of Naturalism must be experienced as a ladder into Transcendence, not as an obstacle to be overcome. One must not play with the toys of the world that are crushed into dust with every movement. To keep grabbing a new, always vanishing, this or that <em>thing,</em> is but a reflection of the unthinking, that is not grounded in Nihilism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When one holds to any form of optimism as they speak of the Other, one knows that this person has not been grasped by the Nothing of the world. While we are all damned to some particular idolatry, optimism is one of its lowest forms. The fanaticism of thought that brews in the fear of Nihilism is only a turning away from Nihilism, an illusion of comfort; there is no embracing, there is no participation in the Nothingness. The worldly religions are fundamentally fanatical in nature due to their turning away of Nihilism; a failed attempt to do the impossible: mask up Nihilism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spong, in his desire to ‘revive’ the dying language of Christianity, says: “We fear that if theism is dismissed, only a bottomless pit remains.” and “Many forms of religion are little more than cultural manifestations of the fear of nothingness. That is why people become hysterical when theism is challenged.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One last mention on the falsity of ‘optimism’ is deserving, if only because it is the overwhelming strain of thought within the current American culture; this ‘optimism’ shows itself in forms of ‘prosperity churches’ all the way to some type of foundationless ‘humanism’. Quoting St. Seraphim Rose once more will thus prove to be deserving: “And indeed the Christian is, in a certain sense–in an ultimate sense–a “Nihilist”; for to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all. This is, of course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined here, where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian’s is a “Nihilism” that proceeds from abundance. The true Nihilist places his faith in things that pass away and end in nothing; all “optimism” on this foundation is clearly futile.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A relevant example of this sort of ‘unthinking’, or lack of search for Transcendence, can be shown within the mindset of a majority of practicing scientists of today. Science, assuming a ‘realist’ perspective, as describing ‘reality’ with physical laws, allows one to predict and ‘know’ what is or will happen within the world. However, to stop at this formal description of reality is unphilosophical. The Philosopher wants to ask why the descriptions of science are the way they are. It is ‘understood’ that ‘particles’ and ‘molecules’ bump into one another in a particular pattern which produce the physical objects that we see around us and even ourselves. To comprehend a description of things is not to comprehend why, seemingly mindless particles and molecules are acting in the ways in which they do. Why are there ‘things’, why are these ‘things’ following a particular rational structure, and why is a there a ‘building’ process found within these ‘things’? These philosophical questions are shunned by a majority of mainstream scientific ‘intellectuals’. This sort of ‘unthinking’ is what has produced the ‘optimistic’ scientism of the current times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a similar criticism of ‘unthinking’ to be made against traditional ‘religious’ interpretations of the human condition. Many religious interpretations of the human experience are replete with theological assumptions that are not necessarily grounded in human experience; these take the forms of rituals, prayers, moral declarations, metaphysical claims, and so on. However, a language that prepares ‘answers’ or ‘rational defenses’ rather than opening up the mystery of the ground of all things must be labeled as a lower form of idolatry. These assumptions, as with many religious languages, are the reason why Heidegger proclaimed that a ‘Christian philosophy’ was the equivalent of a ‘round-square’. Heidegger’s thought is that the religious languages that have so far been developed are restrictive of the human experience of the Other. In other words, religions with their theologies contain too many assumptions and ‘answers’ that shun the mystery of existence. Philosophy, on the other hand, the relentless ‘Why?’, is what is needed in order to open up the mystery of Being, instead of closing it off and pushing it into a closet. One cannot turn the Other into the worldly, whether that attempt is through reason or myth. These are simple, lower forms of idolatry.</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra Notes and Quotes</strong> <strong>(mostly Heidegger,</strong></p><p><strong>much work needed on this section)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“In particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite with which one can concern oneself; the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these ‘says’ anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have any involvement. <strong><em>The world in which I exist has sunk into insignificance; and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement. Anxiety is anxious in the face of the “nothing” of the world</em></strong>; but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what is present-at-hand within-the-world.

But this means original dread is suppressed for the most part in existence. Dread is there. It’s only napping. Its breath permanently trembles in existence, only slightly in the apprehensive, and inaudibly in the “Uh húh!” and “Húh uh!” of those who are busy; best of all in the reserved, surest of all at the heart of existence that is daring. But this happens only in those for whom it expends itself in order to preserve the ultimate greatness of existence.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole, transcendence.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“As surely as we never get a sure grasp of the generality of be-ing in itself, just assurely do we all the same find ourselves somehow placed in the midst of the generality of bare be-ing. In the end, there continues to be [besteht]an essential difference between getting a grasp of the whole of be-ing in itself and finding oneself in the midst of be-ing as a whole. The former is impossible in principle. The latter happens all the time in our existence. Of course, it looks just as though in our everyday comings and goings we were holding fast to only just this or that [kind of] be-ing, as though we were lost in this or that realm of be-ing. But no matter how fragmented the daily round may seem, it always maintains be-ing in the unity of a “whole,” although only in the shadows. Even then and precisely just then, when we are not especially busy with things, this “as a whole” overcomes us; for example, in genuine boredom. This is a long way off far off when this or that book or play, job or leisure activity, is boring. It breaks out when “it’s boring.” Profound boredom, like a silent fog insinuating itself in the depths of existence, pulls things, others and oneself into it altogether with remarkable indifference. Such boredom reveals be-ing as a whole.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Idle talk and ambiguity, having seen everything, having understood everything, develop the supposition that Dasein’s disclosedness, which is so available and so prevalent, can guarantee to Dasein that all the possibilities of its Being will be secure, genuine, and full. Through the self-certainty and decidedness of the “they”, it gets spread abroad increasingly that there is no need of authentic understanding or the state-of-mind that goes with it. The supposition of the “they” that one is leading and sustaining a full and genuine ‘life’, brings Dasein a tranquillity, for which everything is ‘in the best of order’ and all doors are open. Falling Being-in-the-world, which tempts itself, is at the same time tranquillizing However, this tranquillity in inauthentic Being does not seduce one into stagnation and inactivity, but drives one into uninhibited ‘hustle’ [“Betriebs”]. Being-fallen into the ‘world’ does not now somehow come to rest. The tempting tranquillization aggravates the falling.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Dasein plunges out of itself into itself, into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic everydayness. But this plunge remains hidden from Dasein by the way things have been publicly interpreted, so much so, indeed, that it gets interpreted as a way of ‘ascending’ and ‘living concretely’.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Everydayness forces its way into the urgency of concern, and divests itself of the fetters of a weary ‘inactive thinking about death’. Death is deferred to ‘sometime later’, and this is done by invoking the so-called ‘general opinion’ [“allgemeine Ermessen”]. Thus the “they” covers up what is peculiar in death’s certainty—that it is possible at any moment.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“By this time we can see phenomenally what falling, as fleeing, flees in the face of. It does not flee in the face of entities within-the-world; these are precisely what it flees towards—as entities alongside which our concern, lost in the “they”, can dwell in tranquillized familiarity. When in falling we flee into the “at-home” of publicness, we flee in the face of the “not-at-home”; that is, we flee in the face of the uncanniness which lies in Dasein…”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Original dread can awaken in existence at any moment. It does not need wakening by an unaccustomed eventuality for that. The depth of its sway corresponds to the scarcity of its possible occasioning. It is permanently on the verge and yet only seldom comes into play to hold us in suspense. The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread makes man the placeholder of no-thing. We are so finite that we are not even able to bring ourselves face to face with no-thing by our own will and resolve.

Instead of fleeing from anxiety, despair, etc. a language that details a description of the human condition and continually asks ‘Why?’ in regards to their existence in the first place.

The writer investigates whether it's possible to develop a language that authentically engages with the concept of Nihilism—a worldview that sees life and the universe as lacking inherent meaning or value. The document contemplates how such a language can navigate the "Nothing" that Nihilism proposes while also allowing for the possibility of transcending this meaninglessness.</p><p>The author references various philosophers and thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, to discuss the challenges of facing the abyss of human consciousness and the ultimate reality—or lack thereof.</p><p>Central to the discussion are questions about the role of philosophical thinking vis-à-vis Nihilism, the potential for a Nihilistic language to express and confront the "Nothing," and the human mind's ability to grapple with a seemingly meaningless existence.</p><h2>Part 1: The Dilemma of Language and Nihilism</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif"></div> The writer begins by addressing the inadequacy of language when it comes to discussing Nihilism. They argue that clichés and "idle talk" fail to capture the depth and implications of a Nihilistic perspective, suggesting that traditional expressions are insufficient to convey the true experience of Nihilism, which is characterized by its non-transferable nature.</p><h2>Part 2: The Human Condition and Nihilism</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.gif"></div> The draft delves into the human tendency to seek meaning and security in the face of a potentially meaningless existence. It questions whether humans can authentically confront Nihilism without succumbing to self-deception or escaping into comforting illusions. The author examines the possibility of "Being-towards-death," as described by Heidegger, and whether humans can embrace this existential standpoint.</p><h2>Part 3: Heidegger's Influence and Language Development</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif"></div> Heidegger's concepts are presented as the foundation for developing a language of Nihilism, with terms such as "anxiety," "authenticity," and "Being-Towards-Death" providing insights into the human condition that could pave the way for a Nihilistic language. However, this raises the question of whether</p><p>Heidegger's analysis, often labeled "atheistic," can be reconciled with religious perspectives, like those of Thomas Merton.</p><h2>Part 4: The Search for a Nihilistic Language</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.gif"></div> The author proposes the term "Nihiltheism" as a way to ground the experience of Nihilism without falling into the traps of naturalistic or religious worldviews. This language is meant to be symbolic and self-critical, always open for reinterpretation. The intention is not to provide comfort from the Nothingness but to confront it and allow for a genuine encounter with the terror of existence.</p><h2>Part 5: The Challenge of Describing Nihilistic Experience</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif"></div> The writer acknowledges the difficulty in finding words that adequately capture the Nihilistic experience. They cite St. Therese of Lisieux's struggle to articulate her spiritual darkness within a Christian framework as an example of the challenges inherent in conveying deeply personal and transformative experiences.</p><h2>Part 6: The Role of Silence and Renunciation</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image007.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image007.gif"></div> The draft suggests that those who have truly encountered Nihilism may be left with no choice but to embrace a silent acknowledgment of their condition. However, it also points out that few are willing to completely renounce the world, underscoring that experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not the same.</p><h2>Part 7: Affirmative Aspects of Nihilism</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif"></div> The author explores whether there is something affirmative within the experience of Nihilism that can be used to develop a language capable of acknowledging and transcending worldly suffering. They reference the mystic Cioran’s idea of the</p><p>"affirmative substance" of Nothing, where even in the realization of life's futility, one can find a path towards a higher reality.</p><h2>Part 8: The Need for a New Language</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif"></div> The need for a language that addresses Nihilism is tied to the human desire to confront rather than replace the Transcendental yearning that Nihilism evokes. The writer quotes Aldous Huxley on the limitations of conventional theology and the necessity for a language that can be comprehended only by those who have transcended ordinary, unregenerate experiences.</p><h2>Part 9: Heidegger's Terms as a Foundation</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif"></div> Using Heidegger's framework, the draft outlines the basic structure of a potential language of Nihilism, focusing on the concept of "Being-Towards-Death." This concept involves experiencing anxiety in a profound moment that calls the individual to understand something incommunicable, leading to a sense of insignificance in the world and a push towards authenticity.</p><h2>Part 10: Heidegger vs. Religious Perspectives</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image009.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image009.gif"></div> The author compares Heidegger's notion of "Being-Towards-Death" with the views of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, who also acknowledges the emptiness of constant outward seeking. The comparison raises the question of whether the language of Nihilism could bridge the gap between the atheistic overtones often ascribed to Heidegger's philosophy and the theistic language used by Merton.</p><h2>Part 11: Transcendence Through Nihilism</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif"></div> The writer examines the concept of the "True-Self" and how it might be understood in a way that transcends both naturalistic and religious interpretations. They express skepticism about traditional religious approaches that offer answers rather than embracing the mystery of existence, which is seen as a form of idolatry.</p><h2>Part 12: The Futile Optimism and Scientific Realism</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.gif"></div> The draH criticizes the 'optimistic' outlook prevalent in American culture and certain scientific circles, where empirical reality is regarded as the ultimate truth without questioning the underlying reasons for existence. The author argues that this 'optimistic scientism' is a form of 'unthinking' that fails to acknowledge the deeper philosophical questions.</p><p><strong>Part 13: The Rejection of Traditional Religious</strong></p><h2>Interpretations</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.gif"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The writer takes issue with traditional religious interpretations of the human condition, which oHen rely on unexamined theological assumptions, rituals, and dogmas. By contrast, the proposed language of Nihilism would focus on the relentless inquiry into the nature of Being rather than providing pre-packaged answers</p><h2>Part 14: Conclusion and Further Exploration</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif"></div> In summary, the writer advocates for a language of Nihilism that would serve as a map through the Nothingness of the world without claiming to offer 'truth'. This language should be filled with doubt, continually asking "Why?" and preparing the individual for the possibility of transcendence. The draH concludes with an invitation to further explore the tensions between the experience of Nihilism and the development of a language that can genuinely reflect it.</p><h2>Part 15: Extra Notes and Quotes</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image011.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image011.gif"></div> An assortment of additional thoughts and quotes from Heidegger and other thinkers are provided, which the author plans to incorporate into a more polished piece. These notes reflect the ongoing struggle to articulate a coherent response to Nihilism and suggest the shape that a future language might take.</p><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif"></div> The writer ends with a reflection on the non-transferability of the Nihilistic experience and the paradox of developing a language for something that inherently resists articulation. This contradiction is acknowledged with a degree of irony, suggesting that the very act of trying to create a language for Nihilism may be inherently flawed or futile.</p><h2>Part 16: The Universality and Rarity of Nihilism</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.gif"></div> The draH touches on the universality of the Nihilistic experience, which, while being a fundamental aspect of being human, is rarely confronted directly due to its challenging and unsettling nature. The writer asks why this experience is so infrequently and fully embraced, positing that the difficulty lies in the intensity and profundity of fully realizing Nihilism.</p><h2>Part 17: Final Thoughts on Nihilistic Language</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif"></div> In the concluding thoughts, the author grapples with the purpose and potential utility of a Nihilistic language. They ponder whether such a language serves as a guide through the Nothingness of the world, facilitating a push towards transcendence, or whether it's merely replacing traditional religious rituals with another form of structure. The language of Nihilism is envisioned as a tentative and doubting map, constantly questioning and open to reinterpretation, rather than as a doctrine offering certainty and closure.</p><h2>Part 18: Reflections on Quietism and Solitude</h2><p><div class="imagePluginRoot" imageplugin-align="center" imageplugin-width="0" imageplugin-height="0" imageplugin-maxwidth="503" imageplugin-src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif"><img align="center" width="0" height="0" maxwidth="503" src="file:///C:/Users/adamm/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif"></div> The draH ends with reflections on the relationship between the proposed language and concepts like quietism and solitude. Given that idle talk and distraction are seen as barriers to confronting Nihilism, the language of Nihilism might necessitate solitude and silence as conditions for its development and understanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

It breaks into the ordinary reality, shakes it and drives it beyond itself in an ecstatic way.” Tillich&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“It is the emotion of a creature, submerged and overwhelmed by its own nothingness in contrast to that which is supreme above all creatures.” Otto&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“This is no doubt why modern life, weary of positivism and disillusioned by it, but possessed of neither the strength nor the desire to go beyond the boundaries it has established, has made such a fierce attack upon the work of the mystics.” Shestov&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“The initial revelation of any monastery: everything is nothing. Thus begin all mysticisms. It is less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of nothingness.” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“The last step towards nihilism is the disappearance into divinity.” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“This is a practical philosophy that needs to be applied experientially to be known.” Swami Rama&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Is there some form of empirical data that coincides with the suggestion that the Nihilistic experience has both a Naturalistic and a Transcendent component? How, then, is Nihilism with its Transcendental interpretation to be, in any substantial sense, distinguished from Naturalism? Is Nihilism necessarily to be reduced to naturalism? Are there characteristics of Nihilism that separates itself from, and go beyond, naturalism? Is there any way to 'touch' the Transcendent aspect of Nihilism or are we stuck in the situation of naturalism that Underhill summarizes so succinctly:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“It says in effect: The room in which we find ourselves is fairly comfortable. Draw the curtains, for the night is dark: and let us devote ourselves to describing the furniture.”&nbsp;</div><div>	</div><div>Is this our reality?  Even with all the strong descriptions of Nihilism that are found within a Tillich, a Cioran, a Heisman, a Kierkegaard, and so forth, there seems to be something missing. Was Nietzsche right when he stated that there was no reason to convince oneself of a 'true world'? Would, or should, Heisman have blown his brains out all over the Harvard library steps if he encountered something more within Nihilism? Maybe. Maybe not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The claim is that the Nihilistic experience is in part 'mystical'. The groundwork for a wholly Transcendent experience is laid within in the experience of the Nothing of the world which allows for the further possibility of an 'opening up' of the Other. The experience of Nothingness within (and of) the world does not bring forth any 'concrete' forms of the Other. However, an inexplicable, haunting sensation lingers within, creating a suspicion, intensifying to the point of a “pushing”, for one to confront the Other by a 'clearing of the path', a renunciation of the distractions of the world, a pursuit and participation with the Nothingness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“since i will not die right away, nor regain my innocence, going through the same routine motions every day is sheer madness. banality must be overcome at all costs and the way cleared for transfiguration. how sad to see men bypass themselves, neglect their own destiny instead of rekindling the light they carry within them or getting drunk on their abysmal darkness!” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“If we truly want to follow God we must seek to be other-worldly.” Tozer&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>What is lacking from its seemingly omnipotent character, is that the Naturalistic (World) interpretation of Nihilism is the 'fuller'/'concrete' expression of that suspicious echo, which is heard, yet has no message to interpret.  Allowing for only the looming of a suspicion that will not seem to completely fade. The descriptions found in even the most 'profound thinkers' is what we may refer to as the 'diminished' or Worldly versions of Nihilism, i.e. the Nothing of the world.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is another aspect of the Nihilistic experience that is seemingly 'beyond', but one is not in a position to say whether this suspicious whisper exists solely within, or whether it is incoherent with, or something totally separate and unrelated from the Worldly form of Nihilism. Regardless of the ascendant nature of the 'other half'(?) of the experience, this form is even still subsumed by the Nothing of the world. In other words, the 'deeper' experiences of Nihilism that may or may not be entirely worldly are as rarely explored or experienced as its Naturalistic counterpart. With that said, there is a 'wider' experience of Nihilism, there is a more direct confrontation to be had. This is found in what is normally referred to as the psychedelic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>### (I need to rewrite the above paragraph, as it mentions/describes "too much" or goes too far, as it almost foreshadows the consequences of the Transcendent experience, before it has even happened)</div><div><br></div><div>The psychedelic experience can be mystical. What is a 'mystical experience'? Broadly stated, the mystical experience eradicates the ego. The worldly 'I' is erased from its entirety, yet there is something that remains. There is a disconnect from the worldly flesh-body that is experienced as wholly incorporeal. While there is no ego to be found, this 'something' that resembles a 'you' remains; yet this different sort of 'you' is not all there is either. There is a 'bigger something'; there is a meeting with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Nihilism in its fully Transcendent forms is experienced in such a way that it can be described as an Augmented version of experiencing the Nothing of the world. The Nothing of the world and the Transcendent experiences of Nihilism are simply variants of each other. The Transcendent form of Nihilism coincides with what is normally labeled as 'mystical'. This Augmented form of Nihilism is a true 'opening up' of the Transcendent. There is close similarity in the comparison to the 'two-sided' experiences of Nihilism, as Transcendent and as Naturalistic, as is found within human consciousness as the divided-self as part Transcendent and part Natural. The 'external' appearance of Transcendent Nihilism is one that is indeed taken as an encounter with the Other, while the naturalistic aspect of Nihilism is one that 'hears a 'message' that is coming 'from me and beyond me', yet within the world. And although they differ in pure experience, they are not in conflict with one another; they lend themselves to each other in a cohesive fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“It is a mistake to supposed that mysticism derives from a softening of the instincts, from a compromised vitality...To get a sense of them, imagine a Hernando Cortez in the middle of an invisible geography. The German mystics were conquerors too.” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>"Quietism": the difference between the tense stillness of the athlete and the limp passivity of the sluggard, who is really lazy, though he looks resigned. True "Quiet" is a means, not an end: is actively embraced, not passively endured. It is a phase in the self's growth in contemplation; a bridge which leads from its old and uncoordinated life of activity to its new unified life of deep action--the real "mystic life" of man.” Underhill&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“He calls suffering the “gymnastic of eternity,” the “terrible initiative caress of God”; recognizing in it a quality for which the disagreeable rearrangement of nerve molecules cannot account. Sometimes, in the excess of his optimism, he puts to the test of practice this theory with all its implications. Refusing to be deluded by the pleasures of the sense world, he accepts instead of avoiding pain, and becomes an ascetic; a puzzling type for the convinced naturalist, who, falling back upon contempt—that favourite resource of the frustrated reason—can only regard him as diseased.” Underhill&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Believe me, children, one who would know much about these high matters would often have to keep his bed, for his bodily frame could not support it.” Tauler&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The Transcendent aspect of the Nihilistic experience stays mostly hidden due to a lack of participation or pursued confrontation with the Other. Many don't even know that it exists; or if they do, they have misconceptions about it due to the babble from people who have never experienced it themselves. Most 'spiritual' journeys consists of meditation, contemplation, various mortifications, and so on. Yet, even though these practices are performed with the aim of attaining a mystical experience, most fail at ever achieving this end (at least in such an awe-inspiring fashion).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“In order to go into it, man must empty himself of all the finite contents of his ordinary life; he must</div><div>surrender all preliminary concerns for the sake of the ultimate concern. He must transcend the division of existence...The ultimate is beyond this division, and he who wants to reach the ultimate must overcome this division in himself by meditation, contemplation and ecstasy.” Tillich&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“First Bach fugues, a bore...But training changes the structure of our spiritual experiences. In due course, contact with an obscurely beautiful poem, an elaborate piece of counterpoint or of mathematical reasoning, causes us to feel direct intuitions of beauty and significance.” Huxley&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>These traditional practices need not be necessarily ridiculed as either inefficient nor as hindrances; these practices are seemingly beneficial. But is there something more? Is there another way that 'guarantees' a confrontation with the Other? We believe there is a way and that it does not take years of study, ritual, and practice in order to achieve this state (although these practices cannot be ignored as they are useful tools for the experience, even if they do not, in themselves, produce an encounter).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The psychedelic journey is one that, if properly prepared for, can open up the abyss of existence in which no words, thoughts, systems, religions, and so forth, can prepare one for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>If one one wants to pursue, if one wants to confront and participate with the Other, with Transcendent Nihilism, then one only needs a few grams of psilocybin for their worldview to be irreconcilably disrupted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For those who have experienced this Mystical Nothingness, there is an unthinking enthusiasm involved which pushes one into a frenzy of confusion due to the uncanny and terrifying nature that is like nothing found within the world.  As with the 'Temporal' forms of Nihilism, there is still a strong motivation to proclaim the unreality of the experience of the Transcendent.  And, again, in the form of retreating back into the world, and taking the meaningless as meaningful, to cover up the horrid experience of Nothingness.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This 'moving past' is the birth of all confusion and discord. When one grasps and misuses finite language as a literal description of the Wholly-Other the experience of Nihilism is inevitably obfuscated. One must speak to oneself when discussing the Other. Finite human language is necessarily symbolic in nature with regards to speaking of the Other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...any experience, no matter how spiritual, could only yield us an It.” Buber&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>These words are only a distraction, worthless nothings which are only written out of cowardice to confront the Other. I begged to be 'kept' where I was as I experienced a timeless, Ultimate unity; I felt 'at home' and infinitely satisfied. With that said, it has been over a year and I have not been able to push myself into another encounter; terrifying bliss like nothing I have ever experienced before. I feel both unworthy of 'Its' presence and I also cannot escape the pathetic, naturalistic side of my divided-self from being paralyzed with fear from another encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>What if one does 'meet' this Other and yet is still not convinced? What if one meets this Other and still does not know what to do? The real question is this: what if one 'meets' this Other and still cannot hold to any delusion set forth by other humans who have supposedly gone through this experience, nor develop any symbols that show relevance to the Other? All concrete symbols of Transcendence are dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>What do we say about this unspeakable world? Is it purely illusory? A misinterpretation of a trick that is played on us by our mind? For one who has not experienced, this may pass off as an 'explanation'. For those who have experienced the Transcendent forms of Nihilism, it cannot be dismissed so easily. There is a something that one encounters within this Transcendent experience of Nihilism. One may rush to call it 'God'. Others may dismiss it as the workings of the 'subconscious'. Whatever the explanation, it is peculiar that the Nothingness found within the world is magnified to unmeasurable heights when in the face of this Other, this 'something'. This Other world is experienced as more real than the mundane, everyday world. The 'true' illusion becomes what all consider the 'real' or 'only' world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Mescalin opens up the way of Mary, but shuts the door on that of Martha. It gives access to contemplation— but to a contemplation that is incompatible with action and even with the will to action, the very thought of action. In the intervals between his revelations the mescalin taker is apt to feel that, though in one way everything is supremely as it should be, in another there is something wrong. His problem is essentially the same as that which confronts the quietest...” Huxley&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>There is a terrifying bliss that surrounds your entire Being, without you being who you are. There is a dissolution of the ego, the worldly self that is concerned with security, money, relationships, and so on. All human aspects of worldly-consciousness drop out; they do not simply become insignificant, as with experiencing the Nothing of the world, rather they utterly dissipate, they are no where to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Absence, extinction, and unoccupancy--these are not the Buddhist conception of emptiness. Buddhists' Emptiness is not on the plane of relativity. It is Absolute Emptiness transcending all forms of mutual relationship, of subject and object, birth and death, God and the world, something and nothing, yes and no, affirmation and negation. In Buddhist Emptiness there is no time, no space, no becoming, no-thing-ness; it is what makes all these things possible; it is a zero full of infinite possibilities, it is a void of inexhaustible contents.” Suzuki&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>To confront, there must be a dissolution of the 'I' or of the ego; this is what psylocibin does with utter ease. There must be renunciation. The Other demands that we renounce. If you are do not reduce yourself into as pure a form humility as one can achieve, if you do not renounce the ego, the self, if you hold on, well, then, you will bring a nightmare upon yourself like never experienced before. The preparation of renunciation begins with the experiencing the Nothing of the world. One must give up holding onto the deadness of the world. The transitory nature of all things within the world are nothing but distractions that deflect the Other. What is it to experience oneself as Nothing, if it is not a dissolution of the ego? To renounce worldly desires, ambitions, and any other form of illusion, is to embrace the Nothing of the world, which allows for a 'clearer' experience of the Other. The dissolution of the 'I' brings forth the greatest sensation of Unity. A feeling of pure consciousness that is One with all of existence; it is pure existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“To the extent that there is attachment to 'I,' 'Me,' 'Mine,' there is no attachment to, and therefore no unitive knowledge of, the divine Ground.” Huxley&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“The ultimate abandonment of one’s role is not to have a self as a fixed point of reference; it is the freedom to manifest God through one’s own uniqueness. This monk had hit bottom. But the bottom in the spiritual journey is also the top. To be no one is to be everyone. To be no self is to be the true Self. To be nothing is to be everything. In a sense, it is to be God.” Keating&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...it would seem that there is within each of us an enemy which we tolerate at our peril. Jesus called it "life" and "self," or as we would say, the self-life. Its chief characteristic is its possessiveness: the words "gain" and "profit" suggest this. To allow this enemy to live is in the end to lose everything.” Tozer&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“The void- myself without me- is the liquidation of the adventure of the 'I'- it is being without any trace of being, a blessed engulfment, an incomparable disaster.” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“I am sorry sometimes that God no longer fills us with dread. If only we could feel again the primordial quiver of dread in front of the unknown!” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>When is one truly ready to confront something Infinite, something wholly Other? This is not a 'meeting' with another object within the world, this is a confrontation with Existence itself, in the fullest sense of the term. This confrontation is so different that it can easily push one into a state of panic that will be unrecognizable. The naturalistic side of the divided-self, the side that pulls us down into the world, turns produces a fear that is unimaginable. The 'Hellish' confrontation with the Other, the terrifying bliss of the experience, is something that cannot be boxed away within human language or dismissed as illusory or 'natural'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Some people talk as if meeting the gaze of absolute goodness would be fun. They need to think again.” C. S. Lewis&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...terror fraught with an inward shuddering such as not even the most menacing and overpowering created thing can instil.” Otto&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>"The infinite depth repels and horrifies me; the infinite height attracts and satisfies me.” Tolstoy&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Although this painful martyrdom of horrible desolation and passive purgation be so tremendous, that with reason it hast gotten the name of Hell amongst mystick Divines, (because it seems impossible to be able to live a moment with so grievous a torment; so that with great reason it may be said, that he that suffers it, lives dying, and dying lives a lingring death) yet know, that it is necessary to endure it, to arrive at the sweet, joyous and abundant riches of high contemplation and loving union: and there has been no holy Soul, which has not passed through this spiritual martyrdom and painful torment.” Molinos&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Mysticism revolves around the passion for ecstasy and a horror of the void. One cannot know one without the other...Once it has totally rejected the world, the soul is ripe for a long-term and fecund emptiness…One sees nothing except nothingness. And the latter has become</div><div><br></div><div>everything. Ecstasy is plenitude in a void, a full void. It is an overwhelming frisson which convulses nothingness, an invasion of being in absolute emptiness.” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Is there a way to 'guide' oneself through this confrontation? Music, with its abstract nature, is suited best for such a journey. For assistance with the death of the 'I', to release from the naturalistic side of the self, the abstract nature of music, with its strange use of plucking sounds from 'nowhere' with the equally important 'rests' in between each note, as a form of language, allows one to more-fully dispense with the natural-self. Music without words will do best, since any human voice may cause a distraction and pull one down and away from the Other. Bach's organ music, a God-like instrument with God-like tones, will guide one through the journey with the Other. Bach's organ works express fully his meditations on death. Focus on the bass/pedal notes, let the highs and mids come at you, and allow for the Bach, who speaks fluently the 'language of God', to show you the Other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...and yet it does not matter that he’s all in bits. The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren’t lulled into a sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of course it’s dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn’t get back, out of the chaos…” Huxley&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...the Schopenhauerian theory in majorem musicae gloriam [for the greater glory of music] - that is to say, by means of the sovereignty of music, as Schopenhauer understood it; music abstracted from and opposed to all the other arts, music as the independent art-in-itself, not like the other arts, affording reflections of the phenomenal world, but rather the language of the will itself, speaking straight out of the "abyss" as its most personal, original, and direct manifestation.” Nietzsche&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Bach's music is the medium of heavenly transfiguration.” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...Bach often meditated on death...Handel compared to Bach, is of this world. Bach is divine...” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Listening to Bach, one sees God come into being. His music generates divinity. After a Bach...one feels that God must exists. Otherwise, Bach's music would be only heartrending illusion. Theologians and philosophers wasted so many days and nights searching for proofs of his existence, ignoring the only valid one: Bach.” Cioran&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“If humans are emotion machines, then music must work, in some sense, like a machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Music could be a form of emotional technology to control my own behavior intelligently. In other words, if emotions are the products of material processes, then art could be viewed as a form of&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>technology. From the standpoint of this musical materialism, as one of the most extreme implications of an unadulterated materialism, lay a possible solution to dominance of my own&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>analytic and objective tendency to materialize everything. I began to listen to music, especially German music (and especially Wagner and Bach), as a form of technology to counter my own tendencies to view everything as material or technology.” Heisman&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Bach is ground from outside of myself that makes up for the nihilistic lack of ground within myself. Bach counters my material self-consistency and its tendency towards self-decomposition&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>with a form of holistic-mind order.” Heisman&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Plato describes Transcendent Nihilism and the seemingly 'true' mindset to have in the face of this Nothing:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...the entire soul is pierced and maddened and pained, and at the recollection of beauty is again delighted. And from both of them together the soul is oppressed at the strangeness of her condition, and is in a great strait and excitement, and in her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide in her place by day. And wherever she thinks that she will behold the beautiful one, thither in her desire she runs. And when she has seen him, and bathed herself in the waters of beauty, her constraint is loosened, and she is refreshed, and has no more pangs and pains; and this is the sweetest of all pleasures at the time, and is the reason why the soul of the lover will never forsake his beautiful one, whom he esteems above all; he has forgotten mother and brethren and companions, and he thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property; the rules and proprieties of life, on which he formerly prided himself, he now despises, and is ready to sleep like a servant, wherever he is allowed, as near as he can to his desired one, who is the object of his worship, and the physician who can alone assuage the greatness of his pain.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>At the same time, two-thousand years ago, Plato describes the divided-self, and the fleeing into the world of constant distraction, of the human condition as if he is speaking of one of our contemporaries: “Now he who is not newly initiated or who has become corrupted, does not easily rise out of this world to the sight of true beauty in the other; he looks only at her earthly namesake, and instead of being awed at the sight of her, he is given over to pleasure, and like a brutish beast he rushes on to enjoy and beget; he consorts with wantonness, and is not afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure in violation of nature.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>As has been said, the Nihilist cannot turn to the dead world of distractions. Everything has died. How does one begin to interpret this experience that no words can grasp? The world's religions may be of some help, but they can never settle the issue. Is there some language that can be developed in order to help one properly address the Nothing? Huxley sums up this need quite well:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...the ultimate Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended, except by those who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit. This being so, it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the experience of nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so little conviction. This kind of empirical theology is on precisely the same footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience of naked-eye observers.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Philosophy, or conceptual thinking, seems to help pave the way to allow for a better 'understanding' of the ineffable, but, even still, there is no new 'knowledge' gained. The universe will dissipate before your very eyes. The flow of 'information' will come at you at an infinite rate. You will be demanded to renounce, to let go, to show true humility. The non-movement as a result of a total lack of values, of an utter insignificance of the human world, goes hand in hand with a Quietist contemplative existence within the Nothing of the world. Why is it that the psychedelic experience is one which ushers in a mystical experience that confirms the meaninglessness of the world?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“...whilst in that state of abstraction rising higher, perceiving there is a place beyond any bodily condition, adding still and persevering further in practising wisdom, rejecting this fourth dhyâna, firmly resolved to persevere in the search, still contriving to put away every desire after form, gradually from every pore of the body there is perceived a feeling of empty release, and in the end this extends to every solid part, so that the whole is perfected in an apprehension of emptiness. In brief, perceiving no limits to this emptiness, there is opened to the view boundless knowledge. Endowed with inward rest and peace, the idea of 'I' departs, and the object of 'I'—clearly discriminating the non-existence of matter, this is the condition of immaterial life.” Buddha&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>If one wishes to rush to a 'conclusion' and attempt to wrap up the infinite within one of the worldly religions, in order to live in the world, in order to 'make sense' of such a confrontation, then one is only fleeing from Nihilism and ultimately doing a disservice to the 'something' that one meets on the psychedelic journey. This is not about belief or developing a system or trying to box in Nihilism. One must accept the utter mystery behind Nihilism as something too 'powerful' to be confined in the finite. There is only the Infinite Conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>One encounters Nothingness in the Transcendent experience of Nihilism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Therewith, they learn that It is the Cause of all things and yet Itself is nothing, because It super-essentially transcends them all.” Pseudo-Dionysius&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“In statements such as Eckhart's, God is equated with nothing.” Huxley&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Huxley further goes on to confirm the Nihilist's experience of the Nothing of oneself:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Cheap,” I commented. “Trivial. Like things in a five-and-ten.” And all this shoddiness existed in a closed, cramped universe. “It’s as though one were below decks in a ship,” I said. “A five-and-ten-cent ship.” And as I looked, it became very clear that this five-and-ten-cent ship was in some way connected with human pretensions, with the portrait of Cézanne, with A.B. among the Dolomites overacting his favorite character in fiction. This suffocating interior of a dime-store ship was my own personal self; these gimcrack mobiles of tin and plastic were my personal contributions to the universe.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Why is this important? The 'truth' of the experience is one that is confirmed by those separated by time, space, culture, and so on. A repeating of the words of Huxley can be found in the mystic St. Molinos: “Knowing that thou art nothing, that thou canst do nothing, and art worth just nothing, thou wilt quietly embrace passive drynesses, thou wilt endure horrible desolations; thou wilt undergo spiritual</div><div>martyrdoms and inward torments. By means of this Nothing thou must die in thy self, many ways, at all times, and all hours, Keeping thy self in Nothing, thou wilt bar the door against every thing that is not God”. Molinos further states: “But the happy Soul which is gotten to this holy hatred of it self, lives overwhelmed, drowned and swallowed up in the depth of its own Nothing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Within mystical experiences human truth, better put, human rationality is no longer a concern. There are 'things' that are brought forth that no human language can describe, that no human being can fully comprehend. The experience is one that must be dealt with subjectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“In life, man proposes, God disposes.” Huxley&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Smith describes his encounter with the Other as such: “The world into which I was ushered was strange, weird, uncanny, significant, and terrifying beyond belief.” Smith, describing his experience himself in a Transcendental manner, also declares: “Revelations can be terrifying.” The mystical experience is not like anything of this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Huxley describes a part of his psychedelic experience as follows: “And then t here is the horror of infinity...I found myself all at once on the brink of panic. This, I suddenly felt, was going too far. Too far, even though the going was into intenser beauty, deeper significance. The fear, as I analyze it in retrospect, was of being overwhelmed, of disintegrating under a pressure of reality greater than a mind, accustomed to living most of the time in a cosy world of symbols, could possibly bear. The literature of religious experience abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the Mysterium tremendum. In theological language, this fear is due to the incompatibility between man’s egotism and the divine purity, between man’s self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“Quite naturally, then, almost no one figures their time to be ill-spent in bickering about some point of scripture or a psycho-philosophical poser rather than in sizing up some superlative individuals who have called into question what we are or what we might be aside from slaves of our egos.” Ligotti&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Is there any better explanation for why philosophers and theologians have 'missed the mark' in their sand-trap of pursuing 'rationality' instead of direct experience? Is there any better reason one could give for the seemingly endless stagnation and frustration that ensues from the 'intellectualizing' of these issues? Is there any doubt as to why the dogmas of the naturalist and of the worldly 'religious' are trapped in a stalemate with their attempts to 'convince' one another with reason and rationality? Reason and rationality have their place, but if there is not an attempt to go beyond, then one necessarily can only obtain a constrained portion of the human condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Huxley sums it up with a question: “How many philosophers, how many theologians, how many professional educators have had the curiosity to open this Door in the Wall? The answer, for all practical purposes, is, None.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>There is no need for a concern over 'spookiness' in any 'supernatural' or 'new age' sense. The particular mystical-type experiences that I have briefly mentioned are not anything special. By 'special', I mean that these experiences can be induced into any one willing to undertake such a task. There is no worry of any 'new age' or 'supernatural' powers underlying any of the claims made here. Any person in the proper set (psychological preparation) and setting (proper surroundings and environment), along with a definite intention for the pursuit is welcome to 'test' the results of such an experience for themselves. There is no need for years of meditation, chanting, yoga, or any other traditional 'religious' interlocutors; although these methods, and others, can be used in correlation with psychedelics which may bring out a fuller and deeper experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>One is now simply left to interpret said experience. Is it wholly naturalistic? Is there anything veritical about the psychedelic experience? Does the encounter with an Infinite Presence relate to an objective reality?  What can be stated, in an emphatic manner, is that the entheigenic induced experience that one is thrown into, as unimaginable and other-worldly as something could be, it somehow not only doesn’t contradictory with the philosophy and insights of Nihilism (as laid out in these pages), but rather provides an affirmation, with a persuasiveness that is complete and omnipotent.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Still, this does not prove anything. While one is tempted to refer to the psychedelic experience as an encounter with the Other, with all its Transcendent, noetic, and paradoxical qualities, there is no explicit contradiction in reducing the experience down to a naturalist interpretation of a confusion of neurons and chemicals, and an ‘other’ that is the revealings of my subconscious unknown.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Regardless of what one holds about the Transcendent form of Nihilism, we get reduced back to our normal state of consciousness, left with the Nothing of the world. St. Theresa laments: “Oh, what a distress it is for my soul to have to return to hold commerce with this world after having had its conversation in heaven! To have to play a part in the sad farce of this earthly life!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“This, however, is the sublime melancholy of our lot that every You must become an It in our world. However exclusively present it may have been in the direct relationship- as soon as the relationship has run its course or is permeated by means, the You becomes an object among objects, possibly the noblest one and yet one of them, assigned its measure and boundary.” The actualization of the work involves a loss of actuality. Genuine contemplation never lasts long; the natural being that only now revealed itself to me in the mystery of reciprocity has again become describable, analyzable, classifiable- the point in which manifold systems of laws intersect.” Buber&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“How, in other words, can one be a saint and still organize scientific movements of world-historical importance? How does one lean on God and give over everything to Him and still stand on his own feet as a passionate human being? These are not rhetorical questions, they are real ones that go right to the heard of the problem of 'how to be a man'- a problem that no one can satisfactorily advise anyone else on, as the wise William James knew. The whole thing is loaded with ambiguity impossible to resolve.” Becker&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><hr></div><h1>Extra Notes and Quotes</h1><div><br></div><div>Things to add/expand upon-</div><div>1.	“Soma” from Hindu traditions- do research</div><div>2.	In your section on Transcendent experiences, you could propose that Nihilism's existential emptiness or meaninglessness is not an endpoint but rather a mirroring or earthly reflection of a higher, more unified state of consciousness described in Vedanta. This void or emptiness could be conceived as a form of 'Maya' (illusion), a state to be transcended, as proposed in Vedantic tradition, to reach the oneness of 'Brahman'. The journey from Nihilism's existential emptiness to Vedanta's concept of 'Brahman' could be seen as a metaphysical progression, one that both broadens and deepens the concept of Nihiltheism.</div><div>3.	Vivekananda, an ardent proponent of Vedanta, emphasized the universality of these experiences, which can harmonize with your aim to reconcile different philosophical and religious traditions under the umbrella of Nihiltheism. By introducing these Vedantic ideas, your exploration of the Transcendent nature of Nihilistic experiences becomes more nuanced and globally inclusive.</div><div>4.	The “Nihiltheism Summaries” have some good descriptions of the ‘clearing of the path’ after the Worldly experience of Nihilism, but before the Transcendent experience of Nihilism; make sure to review and incorporate what I feel works.&nbsp;</div><div>5.	Make sure the phenomenology of the “Worldly"/diminished” and the “Transcendent/augmented” experiences is further drawn out with much more detail.&nbsp;</div><div>6.	Narrate the idea of being 'dropped back down into the world’: Explore the transition alongside the psychological disorientation after such Transcendent experiences. Delve into the feeling of having witnessed something extraordinary, and wanting to stay. Yet the Nothing of the world takes back over, and the irremovable doubt sets back in. Use these quotes probably here: These two quotes play into the difficulties of coming back into the Worldly Nothing, and the unending doubt that comes along with it: “_When we have tasted the sweetness of the Spirit, all that is flesh becomes insipid; that is, it profits us no more, and the ways of sense are no longer pleasing.”_</div><div>7.	Theresa of Avila- says the same thing- “Oh, what a distress it is for my soul to have to return to hold commerce with this world after having had its conversation in heaven! To have to play a part in the sad farce of this earthly life!”_</div><div>8.	An importance of the sense of the ‘Infinite’ was that it was a Nothingness, it wasn’t any thing, yet is was literally everything.</div><div>9.	Investigate the idea of Transcendent being a part of the subconscious mind: Postulate on how the evolution of human consciousness over millions of years might be wired for this - and that these experiences could be innate parts of ourselves we encounter very rarely. Give substance to this concept by confronting how it might alter our perception of Transcendence and deepen our understanding of the self.&nbsp;</div><div>10.	Explore explicitly a feeling of a sense of familiarity: Even beside its strange, otherworldly sense, the experiential communion with the Transcendent can generate a wrenching form of 'remembrance' or familiarity or “at home". Part of our natural selves intersect with these unfathomable experiences that reconnect us with our deepest psychological roots and memories. Maybe Plato’s Forms/Theory of Recollection, find Plato’s quote of Socrates saying we’ve had knowledge of the Forms before, mention Sister Eileen telling me at a young age I was with God, forever, before I was born.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In the Wholly-Other nature of the experience, there is the easy step of understanding how the conception of ‘Hell’ came to be. If one does not submit, if one is not humble, you will experience hell.</div><div><br></div><div>How does one 'participate'? How does one get ready for such an encounter? What about 'spontaneous' 'revelations' instead of 'pursued'? Write about the terrifying feeling of 'nothingness' how Otto, Molinos, etc. did and then how that relates to the hellish nature found in experiencing the wholly other. Did these people, like Tillich, who express the Naturalistic side of Nihilism, or Nihilism within the world, ever experience the sort of Mystical ecstasy that correlates, but must be distinguished from, the purely naturalistic side, the side that hears the indefinite call within the world, i.e. from me and beyond me? E.g. Nietzsche says he has no reason for believing in the true world; “One simply lacks any reason for convincing oneself that there is a true world.”. Why is it important that I ask if they have? Is it because one gets to 'participate' with the Other directly that is only hinted at in the 'message' of Nihilism in it's earthly sense? The inability to speak about the psychedelic experience is 'proof' that there is an Infinite/finite gap. It's still a 'void', it's just that one looks into the void. Peace, confusion, learning/recollection, uncanny, terrifying, utterly satisfying.</div><div><br></div><div>Plato/Socrates-</div><div><br></div><div>“Few only retain an adequate remembrance of them; and they, when they behold here any image of that other world, are rapt in amazement, but they are ignorant of what this rapture means, because they do not clearly perceive. For there is no light of justice or temperance or any of the higher ideas which are precious to souls in the earthly copies of them: they are seen through a glass dimly; and there are few who, going to the images, behold in them the realities, and these only with difficulty.”</div><div><br></div><div>“The lovers of knowledge are conscious that the soul was simply fastened and glued to the body—until philosophy received her, she could only view real existence through the bars of a prison, not in and through herself...”</div><div><br></div><div>Phaedo- “...I desire to prove to you that the real philosopher has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die, and that after death he may hope to obtain the greatest good in the other world...For I deem that the true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men; they do not perceive that he is always pursuing death and dying; and if this be so, and he has had the desire of death all his life long, why when his time comes should he repine at that which he has been always pursuing and desiring?”</div><div><br></div><div>“...the rest of the world are of opinion that to him who has no sense of pleasure and no part in bodily pleasure, life is not worth having; and that he who is indifferent about them is as good as dead.”</div><div><br></div><div>Look into quotes from St. Theresa Journal- pg. 166”</div><div><br></div><div>I should use this section on mysticism to really focus on Cioran, specifically On the Heights of Despair and Tears and Saints and Molinos. He has the most 'atheistic' mystical language and there are so many quotes and great descriptions of what I am attempting to put forth. The need to 'promote' the 'true' religious mindset found in Cioran, who is normally labeled as a 'nihilist'. This needs to be dispelled. This section will highlight 'Nihiltheism' that is not grounded 'simply' in saints or other 'Christian' or 'religious' context. Huxley and Smith is a good start, since they work from a psychedelic viewpoint, rather than a explicitly 'religious'. Use Cioran's quotes for mysticism in this section, but keep in mind his ideas on 'madness' or mental health for the 'Suicide' section.</div><div><br></div><div>“Where, for any reason, physical or moral, the psychological dispositions are unsatisfactory, the removal of obstacles by a drug or by ascetic practices will result in a negative rather than a positive spiritual experience. Such an infernal experience is extremely distressing, but may also be extremely salutary. There are plenty of people to whom a few hours in hell— the hell that they themselves have done so much to create— could do a world of good.” Huxley</div><div><br></div><div>The same experience of Nihilism- the Nothing of the world is a diminished variant of the Transcendent version. Nothingness is just the dissolution of the 'I', of the ego. The ego fears the Other.</div><div><br></div><div>“The instant cure of most of our religious ills would be to enter the Presence in</div><div><br></div><div>spiritual experience, to become suddenly aware that we are in God and that God is in us.”  Tozer</div><div><br></div><div>“I am sorry sometimes that God no longer fills us with dread. If only we could feel again the primordial quiver of dread in front of the unknown!” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“How desist from what we shall never recover, from that pathetic and unheard of nothing which bears our name...we can vanquish it only by means of a sudden whirlwind which, sweeping away the ego, leaves us alone, without anyone, without ourselves...” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“Through psychedelics we are learning that God is not an idea, God is a lost continent in the human mind.” Mckenna</div><div><br></div><div>“He gave us two words: one is intellectual knowledge, and the other is realization. That is to say, intellectual assent is within this realization, and realization is beyond it. Therefore intellectual assent is not sufficient. Every man can say this theory is right, but that is not realization; he must realize it. We can all say we understand that this is hypnotism, but that is not realization. That will be when the hypnotism will break — even for a moment. It will come in a flash; it must come. If you struggle it will come.” Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>“...the infinite distance of the finite from the infinite and, consequently, the negative judgment over any finite attempts to reach the infinite. The feeling of being consumed in the presence of the divine is a profound expression of man's relation to the holy.” Tillich</div><div><br></div><div>“then you will think it useless to express an opinion, to take a stand, to make an impression; the noises you have renounced increase the anxiety of your soul. after having struggled madly to solve all problems, after having suffered on the heights of despair, in the supreme hour of revelation, you will find that the only answer, the only reality, is silence.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“And once our egos have been deposed, what would be left of us? By all recorded accounts, everything would be left except what Horwitz called “a vanity, an elaborate delusion, a ruse.” Ligotti</div><div><br></div><div>“Regardless of the life stories of U. G., Wren-Lewis, and Suzanne Segal, ego-death is a state that has nothing but anecdotal evidence to support it, which groups this phenomenon with mystical experiences and revealed religions.” Ligotti (this is an important quote which demands pessimism. No direct experience of the Other, regardless if it is still illusory or within the 'mind', and one is left with only the Nothing of the world)</div><div><br></div><div>“...'the tragedy of the ego.' This phrase fits like a glove into Zapffe’s theory of consciousness as a tragic blunder. Disappointingly, Metzinger goes on to say that “the tragedy of the ego dissolves because nobody is ever born and nobody ever dies.” This statement is borrowed from Zen Buddhism (the Heart Sutra) and loses something when translated from a monastery to a university lecture hall.” Ligotti</div><div><br></div><div>The 27th of August is when I experienced something Other. What an amazing experience! Understanding, mystery, out of body, fear, humility, and on and on. The entire universe dissolved before my very eyes. I have never experienced anything like it. The sky, the ocean, Bach! What an amazing sort of experience that I cannot imagine not experiencing. Bach uses the language of music, which is God's language, in order to explain the universe to me. The details are for further exploration, but Naturalism seems to be wholly defeated by my experience. I could say that it was simply “me”, but this does not seem to be a possibility.</div><div><br></div><div>I want my last breath to be the same breath that is stolen from me when I fully experience Bach. As insignificant as this brilliant piece of music is, with it's illusory nature of omnipotence, which screams from a containment within even the most advanced architecture of man, only goes to show how unremarkable even the greatest of human achievements appear when placed against the backdrop of the Infinite.</div><div><br></div><div>“Mysticism...is unsatisfactory in moral content. The ultimate reality of the world is not moral ('God is not good') and the mystic who unites himself with ultimate reality is uniting himself with a non-moral being, therefore he is not moral.” Huxley (this is very important, Nihiltheism, must be worked into the writing)</div><div><br></div><div>“The general acceptance of a doctrine that denies meaning and value to the world as a whole, while assigning them in a supreme degree to certain arbitrarily selected parts of the totality, can only have evil and disastrous results...We have thought of ourselves as members of supremely meaningful and valuable communities – deified nations, divine classes and what not – existing within a meaningless universe.” Huxley (just putting this here in order not to forget it. It doesn't belong with mysticism, but it's a strong quote)</div><div><br></div><div>“...ego-death is a state that has nothing but anecdotal evidence to support it, which groups this phenomenon with mystical experiences and revealed religions.” Ligotti</div><div><br></div><div>“A generation ago, in the psychedelic era, people opened themselves to the unconscious before they had the humility or the devotion to God to be able to handle it. The unconscious needs to be respected and approached with prudence.” Keating</div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=Nihiltheism" data-non-editable="true" spellcheck="false" data-upnote-tag="#Nihiltheism" title="#Nihiltheism">#Nihiltheism</a>&nbsp;<a href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=mystical" data-non-editable="true" spellcheck="false" data-upnote-tag="#mystical" title="#mystical">#mystical</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb">The Religious Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f">-Nihilism Preface-</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5">The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384">The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9">Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3">The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0">The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing</a></div><div><br></div></div></div></div></body>

Live here; this is a very bad world indeed, but make the best of it.' Which put in plain language means, live a hypocritical, lying life, a life of continuous fraud, covering all sores in the best way you can. Go on putting patch after patch, until everything is lost, and you are a mass of patchwork. This is what is called practical life. Those that are satisfied with this patchwork will never come to religion. Religion begins with a tremendous dissatisfaction with the present state of things, with our lives, and a hatred, an intense hatred, for this patching up of life, an unbounded disgust for fraud and lies. He alone can be religious who dares say, as the mighty Buddha once said under the Bo-tree, when this idea of practicality appeared before him and he saw that it was nonsense, and yet could not find a way out.” Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>Many have spoken of the Nihilistic experience properly, but almost all turn their back from Nihilism and flee into some activity of distraction. As Heidegger says, one is always falling back into the world.</div><div><br></div><div>“Throwness is neither a 'fact that is finished' nor a fact that is settled. Dasein's facticity is such that as long as it is what it is, Dasein remains in the throw, and is sucked into the turbulence of the 'They's' inauthenticty.” pg. 223</div><div><br></div><div>“In everydayness Dasein can undergo dull ‘suffering’, sink away in the dullness of it, and evade it by seeking new ways in which its dispersion in its affairs may be further dispersed. In the moment of vision, indeed, and often just ‘for that moment’, existence can even gain the mastery over the “everyday”; but it can never extinguish it.” Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>“Nothing is so plain from the course of the existential analytic so far, as the Fact that the ontology of Dasein is always falling back upon the allurements of the way in which Being ordinarily understood.” Heidegger pg. 439</div><div><br></div><div>This divided-self, this double-mindedness, is one in which there is no escape. To make clear, this 'always falling' has been, at least within Western, Christian cultures, painted with the mythological language of 'original sin' (or with a scientific, evolutionary tale that reduces consciousness and all of its phenomenons as a mistake or accident). This unbridgeable disconnect between the finite and the Infinite has been excepted only 'intellectually' while shunned, in action, by almost all with their 'solutions' and 'answers', except the rare few who have the 'stamina' to renounce the world in its entirety and who hold that reality is simply an unreality.</div><div><br></div><div>“Meanwhile time passes. If outward help comes, then life returns to the despairer, he begins where he left off; he had no self, and a self he did not become, but he continues to live on with only the quality of immediacy. If outward help does not come, then in real life something else commonly occurs. Life comes back into him after all, but "he never will be himself again," so he says. He now acquires some little understanding of life, he learns to imitate the other men, noting how they manage to live, and so he too lives after a sort. In Christendom he too is a Christian, goes to church every Sunday, hears and understands the parson, yea, they understand one another; he dies; the parson introduces him into eternity for the price of $10 -- but a self he was not, and a self he did not become.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“A thinker erects an immense building, a system, a system which embraces the whole of existence and world-history etc. -- and if we contemplate his personal life, we discover to our astonishment this terrible and ludicrous fact, that he himself personally does not live in this immense high-vaulted palace, but in a barn alongside of it, or in a dog kennel, or at the most in the porter's lodge. If one were to take the liberty of calling his attention to this by a single word, he would be offended. For he has no fear of being under a delusion, if only he can get the system completed...by means of the delusion.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“In spite of the fact that a man is in despair he can perfectly well live on in the temporal, in fact all the better for it; he may be praised by men, be honored and esteemed, and pursue all the aims of temporal life. What is called worldliness is made up of just such men, who (if one may use the expression) pawn themselves to the world. They use their talents, accumulate money, carry on worldly affairs, calculate shrewdly, etc., etc., are perhaps mentioned in history, but themselves they are not; spiritually understood, they have no self, no self for whose sake they could venture everything, no self before God -- however selfish they may be for all that.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“Is not despair simply double-mindedness? For what is despairing other than to have two wills?” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“Thus did my two wills, one new, and the other old, one carnal, the other spiritual, struggle within me; and by their discord, undid (tore) my soul (apart).” St. Augustine</div><div><br></div><div>“...give me beauty in the inward soul; and may the outward and inward man be at one.” Plato</div><div><br></div><div>“Two enemies- the same man divided.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“Natural good is not simply insufficient in amount and transient, there lurks a falsity in its very being. Cancelled as it all is by death if not by earlier enemies, it gives no final balance, and can never be the thing intended for our lasting worship. It keeps us from our real good, rather; and renunciation and despair of it are our first step in the direction of the truth. There are two lives, the natural and the spiritual, and we must lose the one before we can participate in the other.” James</div><div><br></div><div>“I and You drown; humanity that but now confronted the deity is absorbed into it; glorification, deification, universal unity have appeared. But when one returns into the wretchedness of daily turmoil, transfigured and exhausted, and with a knowing heart reflects on both, is one not bound to feel that Being is split, with one part abandoned to hopelessness?” Buber</div><div><br></div><div>“Nature her self, apparently, will torment thee, she being always an Enemy to the Spirit, which in depriving her of sensible Pleasures, remains Weak, Melancholy, and full of Irksomeness, so that it feels a Hell in all Spiritual Exercises, particularly in that of Prayer, hence it grows extremely impatient to be at an end of it, through the uneasiness of Thoughts, the lassitude of Body, importunate Sleep, and the not being able to curb the Senses, every one of which would for it own share, follow its own Pleasure.” Molinos</div><div><br></div><div>A Jew, a Christian, a Nihilist. There's a 'Hindu' in there too somewhere.</div><div><br></div><div>The naturalistic side of humanity, which constantly pulls one down into the world, into the concerns of the finite, into taking serious the transitory nature of all worldly things, cannot be overcome. The divided-self, the falling nature of man, the 'pulling' in contrary directions as existing as both simultaneously natural and Transcendent, is one that comes with great insights as part of the human condition. This split within the human consciousness helps explain the way in which people cannot live up to the ideals of philosophy/theology/religion etc. and are doomed to be pulled back down, in all its depravity, into the world leaving one with a feeling of 'being guilty'.</div><div><br></div><div>“The common sense of the “They” knows only the satisfying of manipulable rules and public norms and the failure to satisfy them. It reckons up infractions of them and tries to balance them off. It has slunk away from its ownmost Being-guilty so as to be able to talk more loudly about making “mistakes”...Though the call gives no information, it is not merely critical; it is positive, in that it discloses Dasein’s most primordial potentiality-for-Being as Being-guilty..” Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>There is a never ending frustration within the divided nature of human consciousness for which the consequence is described as guilt. The conception of 'guilt', under Heidegger's analysis, gets rescued from a worldly stuckness of a feeling of owing something to someone else or not living up to another's worldly ideals or 'oughts'. 'Guilt', in its existential sense, stems from the 'always falling' condition, as being dragged around by a pure naturalism, as not even attempting to recognize the possibility of one's True-Self. Guilt is not for others, guilt is directed at oneself in the frustrated state of the Natural man who, as Becker puts it, is both 'worm and god'; a 'god who shits'. In Nihilism, others become insignificant and the Original Self becomes one's fascination; there is no longer a feeling of 'owing' anyone or anything. How different, then, is this Self, this inner Transcendent intuition that 'separates' itself from the purely Natural side of man, from the Other? Are they one in the same?</div><div><br></div><div>“on the heights of despair, the passion for the absurd is the only thing that can still throw a demonic light on chaos. When all the current reasons- moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on - no longer guide one's life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness?” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>This 'fascination' with the Transcendent side of the Self takes the form of a renunciation of the world and a turning inward. Only those who are trapped in the game of human morality attempt to 'save' others. Non-movement, a negative 'morality', is left in place of the denial of material concerns. Vivekananda puts it this way:</div><div><br></div><div>“Charity is great, but the moment you say it is all, you run the risk of running into materialism...You Christians, have you found nothing else in the Bible than working for fellow creatures, building hospitals?...The architect of the universe is going to be taught by the carpenters! He has left the world a dirty hole, and you are going to make it a beautiful place! That sort of practical religion is good, not bad; but it is just kindergarten religion. It leads nowhere.”</div><div><br></div><div>“To have faith one must remain passive vis-a-vis the world. The believer must not do anything.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action...Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.” Tao Te Ching</div><div><br></div><div>And Luther maybe puts it most damningly, paraphrasing the influential figure of 'Jesus': “How far different from this is the instruction of Christ: that, we should rather despise the whole world!”</div><div><br></div><div>St. Seraphim Rose is emphatically against any sort of 'utopian' thinking or 'doing good': “First and foremost I radically question the emphasis upon “action” itself, upon “projects” and “planning,” upon concern with the “social” and what man can do about it—all of which acts to the detriment of acceptance of the given, of what God gives us at this moment, as well as of allowing His will to be done, not ours.” He reiterates contrary to human morality: “...it lies, not in the area of “political commitments” and “social responsibilities...If, in so doing, we help to ameliorate or abolish a social evil, that is a good thing—but that is not our goal.”</div><div><br></div><div>“The philosophical portion denounces all work however good, and all pleasure, as loving and kissing wife, husband or children, as useless. According to this doctrine all good works and pleasures are nothing but foolishness and in their very nature impermanent. "All this must come to an end sometime, so end it now; it is vain.” Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>“...it proceeds to 'disvalue' together with the self the tribe to which the person belongs, and indeed, together with that, all existence in general.” Otto</div><div><br></div><div>“Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.” Taoism</div><div><br></div><div>“The slime of personal and emotional love is remotely similar to the water of the Godhead's spiritual being, but of inferior and of insufficient quantity...human beings can do something to mitigate the horrors of their situation by 'keeping one another wet with their slime.' But there can be no happiness or safety in time and no deliverance into eternity, until they give up thinking that slime is enough and, by abandoning themselves to what is in fact their element, call back the eternal waters...the modern idolaters of progress...prefer an agonizing and impossible existence on dry land to love, joy and peace in our native ocean.” Huxley</div><div><br></div><div>“what should i do? work for a social and political system, make a girl miserable? hunt for weaknesses in philosophical systems, fight for moral and esthetic ideals? it's all too little.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“No one has power over the body or over the world. That means there is nothing we can do: let the world exist for itself as it pleases or as it thinks best; we shall learn, and teach others, to do without the world and without the body that belongs to this world.” Shestov</div><div><br></div><div>“All these experimented virtues make a brilliant showing; for an instant they are enchanting like an oriental poem: such self-control, such firmness, such ataraxia, etc., border almost on the fabulous. Yes, they do to be sure; and also at the bottom of it all there is nothing.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>The positive outlook is pathetic. 'Positivity' is giving up, a fleeing from Nihilism. The Pathetic person wants to say that everything is alright, that every thing is “just fine”. It's to ignore our condition. In other words, it's to ignore existence. It is the truly lazy mentality, which the non-movement of the Nihilist is so often accused of. The Nihilist does not like what she sees around her. She shuts down, since there is no ultimate difference in her actions. There is no such thing as “progress”, only mere change from one state of affairs to the next; the definition of arbitrary. The Pathetic person is trying to hold on to their secret. The Pathetic person, instead of retreating into despair pretends to conquer existence by never fully facing it; most of the time running away from it as fast as their distractions will take them.</div><div><br></div><div>The Pathetic person has surrendered, yet continues to pretend, to go through the motions, day after day, with that forced smile upon their face. What kind of existence is worse than this? What a sham! The person who acts out in the world, promotes “progress”, actually helps others, etc., is still nothing more, regardless of all the kicking and screaming, than the frozen figure of “positivity”. There is nothing but fake, inauthentic movements that simulate a life. There is nothing but insignificant change in an insignificant life. Progressive movements are nonsensical.</div><div><br></div><div>The negative appropriation of Nihilism simply exemplifies that the distractions of life have not broken down for such a person; the stranglehold of illusion that worldly meaning has is cancerous to the Transcendental. Worldly meaning spreads into and infects all aspects of our existence, allowing even the most mundane and ridiculous actions to be experienced as 'meaningful'. Assuming an intrinsic value to their being, the finite, nonsensical, ignorant existence of the human is put forth as an ideal with what seems as a complete disregard for the horrific consequences of such a perspective. The words of Kempus have still not traveled far enough: “He is the truly wise man, who counteth all earthly things as dung...”. Ligotti makes this point in his unrelentingly pessimistic tone when he declares: “As a threat to human continuance, nihilism is as dead as God.” A participation with, rather than a fleeing from, is necessary to bring out Nihilism's uttermost forms. Why would anyone want to 'participate' in Nihilism?</div><div><br></div><div>“I am wrong in saying ‘security,’ for there is no security in this life; understand that in such</div><div><br></div><div>cases I always imply: ‘If they do not cease to continue as they have begun.’ What misery to live in this world! We are like men whose enemies are at the door, who must not lay aside their arms, even while sleeping or eating, and are always in dread lest the foe should enter the fortress by some breach in the walls. How canst Thou wish us to prize such a wretched existence?” Theresa of Avila</div><div><br></div><div>“The general acceptance of a doctrine that denies meaning and value to the world as a whole, while assigning them in a supreme degree to certain arbitrarily selected parts of the totality, can only have evil and disastrous results...We have thought of ourselves as members of supremely meaningful and valuable communities – deified nations, divine classes and what not – existing within a meaningless universe.” Huxley</div><div><br></div><div>Instead, the unreality of the world is pushed forth in a form of either an ironically morbid 'optimism' or a blindfolded indifference. One sees this everyday as he confronts another unthinking robot who projects a labored smile as he speaks through his teeth about 'how great it is to be alive.” Or the restrained shudder of inconvenience that comes from one who has just heard the news that a relative or friend has died.</div><div><br></div><div>“only the sick man is delighted by life and praises it so that he won't collapse.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>"Once a fishwife was a guest in the house of a gardener who raised flowers. She came there with her empty basket, after selling fish in the market, and was asked to sleep in a room where flowers were kept. But, because of the fragrance of the flowers, she couldn't get to sleep for a long time. Her hostess saw her condition and said, 'Hello! Why are you tossing from side to side so restlessly?' The fishwife said: 'I don't know, friend. Perhaps the smell of the flowers has been disturbing my sleep. Can you give me my fish-basket? Perhaps that will put me to sleep'." So with us. The majority of mankind delights in this fish smell — this world, this enjoyment of the senses, this money and wealth and chattel and wife and children. All this nonsense of the world — this fishy smell — has grown upon us. We can hear nothing beyond it, can see nothing beyond it; nothing goes beyond it. This is the whole universe.” Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>“The soulish-bodily synthesis in every man is planned with a view to being spirit, such is the building; but the man prefers to dwell in the cellar, that is, in the determinants of sensuousness. And not only does he prefer to dwell in the cellar; no, he loves that to such a degree that he becomes furious if anyone would propose to him to occupy the bel etage which stands empty at his disposition- for in fact he is dwelling in his own house.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“And this corporeal element, my friend, is heavy and weighty and earthy, and is that element of sight by which a soul is depressed and dragged down again into the visible world...” Plato</div><div><br></div><div>“...each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body.” Plato</div><div><br></div><div>“They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;— such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely!” Taoism</div><div><br></div><div>The illusory, subjective nature of all value judgments that pushes us forward, damning us to constantly make value judgments within a valueless world, with our inability to refrain from valuations, is Absurd. As 'solutions' to the Absurd, there are some who put forth a sense of irony, as suggested by Nagel, while others assert various forms of 'indifference'. And while these may be the closest conception of 'equanimity' that one can seemingly grasp in the face of Nihilism, this is still only a process of reasoning about Nihilism, and therefore will be drowned in the encounter with Nihilism. Irony or indifference are effectual to those who are still only 'intellectualizing', rather than actualizing Nihilism. An 'attitude' cannot be reached through a process of one inference to another. The suggestions of irony or indifference not only fail as a 'response' due to lending itself as a distraction from any 'message' that may be found within Nihilism, if there is one to be found, but it is as derisory as requesting the healing of a bullet wound by means of deduction.</div><div><br></div><div>“Humanist stoicism is possible for certain individuals for a certain time: until, that is, the full implications of the denial of immortality strike home. The Liberal lives in a fool's paradise which must collapse before the truth of things. If death is, as the Liberal and Nihilist both believe, the extinction of the individual, then this world and everything in it-love, goodness, sanctity, everything-are as nothing, nothing man may do is of any ultimate consequence and the full horror of life is hidden from man only by the strength of their will to deceive themselves...” Seraphim</div><div><br></div><div>“The absurd man thus catches sight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyond which all is collapse and nothingness. He can then decide to accept such a universe and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation.” Camus</div><div><br></div><div>The majority of unthinking humans retreat into a superficial-selfish interpretation of the religious languages of their time, into the proximity of their family relations, into the distractions of their worldly pleasures. Or as Kierkegaard puts it: “The sectarians deafen one another with their noise and clamor, keep anxiety away with their screeching.” Heidegger says that within the noise and hustle of the world, by avoiding a confrontation with the Authentic Self, the 'They' are 'rewarded' with the illusion of 'ascending' and 'living concretely'.</div><div><br></div><div>“We fear that if theism is dismissed, only a bottomless pit remains...Many forms of religion are little more than cultural manifestations of the fear of nothingness. That is why people become hysterical when theism is challenged.” Spong</div><div><br></div><div>“for them there is only one kind of agony, the one immediately preceding the fall into absolute nothingness. only such moments of agony bring about important existential revelations in consciousness. that is why they expect everything from the end instead of trying to grasp the meaning of a slow revelatory agony. the end will reveal too little, and they will die as ignorant as they have lived.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>Nihilism is wholly-destructive to the world. The one who experiences Nihilism cannot retreat back into the world of 'things'. 'Things' are all too transparent. The world is dead. I wish to quote Tønnessen once more at length, due to both the unfortunately relative obscurity of his paper and for the clear example in which he describes the human situation:</div><div><br></div><div>“The world is what it seems to be to a dry, unimaginative, down to earth, square-headed stuffshirt about mid-morning after a good night's rest. And as for such questions as what it means to live and die – there's nothing to it, it is commonplace, almost everybody does it. We are thrown into an absurdly indifferent world of sticks and stones and stars and emptiness. Our “situation” is that of a man who falls out of the empire state building. Any attempt at “justifying” our brief, accelerating fall, the inconceivably short interlude between our breath-taking realization of our “situation” and our inexorable total destruction, is bound to be equally ludicrous; i.e. whether we choose to say: (a) “This is actually quite comfortable as long as it lasts, let's make the best of it.” or (b) “Let us at least do something useful while we can,” and we start counting the windows on the building. In any event, both attitudes presuppose an ability to divert ourselves from realizing our desperate “situation,” to abstract, as it were, every single moment of the “fall” out of its irreparable totality, to cut our lives up into small portions with petty, short time-span goals.”</div><div><br></div><div>“It is infinitely comic that a man can understand the whole truth about how wretched and petty this world is, etc. -that he can understand this, and then cannot recognize again what he understood; for almost in the same moment he himself goes off and takes part in the same pettiness and wretchedness, takes glory in it and receives glory from it, that is, accepts it.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“We cannot hide a carrion with roses; it is impossible. It would not avail long; for soon the roses would fade, and the carrion would be worse than ever before. So with our lives. We may try to cover our old and festering sores with cloth of gold, but there comes a day when the cloth of gold is removed, and the sore in all its ugliness is revealed.” Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>A relevant example of this sort of 'unthinking', or lack of realization of Transcendence, can be found within the mindset of a majority of practicing scientists today. Science, assuming some form of 'realism', as describing 'reality' with physical laws, allows one to predict and 'know' what is or will happen within the world. However, to stop at this formal description of reality is unphilosophical. The Philosopher wants to ask why the descriptions of science are the way they are. It is 'understood' thatd 'particles' and 'molecules' bump into one another in a particular pattern which produce the physical objects that we see around us, including ourselves. To comprehend a description of things is not to comprehend the 'Why?', i.e. what are the motives that drive seemingly mindless particles and molecules in acting in the ways in which they do? Why are there 'things', why are these 'things' following a particular rational structure, and why is a there a 'building' process found within these 'living things'? These philosophical questions are shunned by a majority of mainstream scientific 'intellectuals' who are satisfied with the 'How?'. This sort of 'unthinking' is what has produced the 'optimistic' scientism of the current times.</div><div><br></div><div>“A "scientific" interpretation of the world as you understand it might consequently still be one of the stupidest, that is to say, the most destitute of significance, of all possible world-interpretations:-I say this in confidence to my friends the Mechanists, who today like to hobnob with philosophers, and absolutely believe that mechanics is the teaching of the first and last laws upon which, as upon a ground-floor, all existence must be built. But an essentially mechanical world would be an essentially meaningless world! Supposing we valued the worth of a music with reference to how much it could be counted, calculated, or formulated -how absurd such a " scientific " estimate of music would be! What would one have apprehended, understood, or discerned in it! Nothing, absolutely nothing of what is really "music" in it!” Nietzsche</div><div><br></div><div>“One would think that neuroscientists and geneticists would have as much reason to head for the cliffs because little by little they have been finding that much of our thought and behavior is attributable to neural wiring and heredity rather than to personal control over the individuals we are, or think we are. But they do not feel suicide to be mandatory just because their laboratory experiments are informing them that human nature may be nothing but puppet nature. Not the slightest tingle of uncanniness or horror runs up and down their spines, only the thrill of discovery.” Ligotti</div><div><br></div><div>“Generally speaking, science has dulled people's minds by diminishing their metaphysical consciousness.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“If I had only to learn how an apple falls to the ground, or how an electric current shakes my nerves, I would commit suicide.” Swami Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>“To pursue science, scientists must be justified by something that, strictly speaking, is not science itself, i.e. curiosity, wonder, faith in science, the will to master all knowledge, belief that</div><div><br></div><div>it will benefit the world, belief in pure knowledge for its own sake, or some other breach of objectivity. Because science, apparently, cannot consistently justify itself, something else must if it is to exist at all.” Heisman</div><div><br></div><div>“In respect to science, which concerns us especially here in the university, the situation of the last few decades, a situation which remains unchanged today despite some cleansing, is easy to see. Although two seemingly different conceptions of science are now seemingly struggling against each other—science as technical and practical professional knowledge and science as a cultural value in itself—nevertheless both are moving along the same decadent path of a misinterpretation and disempowering of the spirit. In all its areas, science today is a technical, practical matter of gaining information and communicating it. No awakening of the spirit at all can proceed from it as science. Science itself needs such an awakening.” Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>“The only question is whether we are willing to fall victim to this cheap look of things and thus take the whole matter as settled, or whether we are capable of experiencing a provocative happening in this recoil of the why-question back upon itself.” Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>There is a similar criticism of 'unthinking' to be made against traditional 'religious' interpretations of the human condition. Many religious interpretations of the human experience are replete with theological assumptions that are not necessarily grounded in human experience; these take the forms of rituals, prayers, moral declarations, metaphysical claims, and so on. However, a language that prepares 'answers' or 'rational defenses' rather than opening up the mystery of the Ground of all things must be labeled as a lower form of idolatry.</div><div><br></div><div>These assumptions, as with many religious languages, are the reason why Heidegger proclaimed that a 'Christian philosophy' was the equivalent of a 'round-square'. Heidegger's thought is that the religious languages that have so far been developed are restrictive of the human experience in that they are attempts to go beyond said experience; any descriptions of the Other is wrongheaded. In other words, religions and their subsequent theologies contain too many assumptions and 'answers' that shun the mystery of existence. Philosophy, on the other hand, as the relentless 'Why?', is what is needed in order to open up the mystery of Being, instead of closing it off and pushing it into a closet. One cannot turn the Other into the worldly, whether that attempt is through reason or myth. And while we are all idolaters, there are simpler, lower forms of idolatry, since they are not confrontations with Nihilism.</div><div><br></div><div>“So the despairing self is constantly building nothing but castles in the air, it fights only in the air. All these experimented virtues make a brilliant showing; for an instant they are enchanting like an oriental poem: such self-control, such firmness, such ataraxia, etc., border almost on the fabulous. Yes, they do to be sure; and also at the bottom of it all there is nothing. The self wants to enjoy the entire satisfaction of making itself into itself, of developing itself, of being itself; it wants to have the honor of this poetical, this masterly plan according to which it has understood itself. And yet in the last resort it is a riddle how it understands itself; just at the instant when it seems to be nearest to having the fabric finished it can arbitrarily resolve the whole thing into nothing.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“...philosophies and doctrines say almost nothing about death. the only valid attitude is absolute silence or a cry of despair. some people maintain that the fear of death does not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i there is no death, and once dead there</div><div><br></div><div>is no i any longer...what comfort does this artificial distinction between the i and death offer a man who has a strong premonition of death? what meaning can logical argument or subtle thought have for someone deeply imbued with a feeling of the irrevocable? all attempts to bring existential questions onto a logical plane are null and void. philosophers are too proud to confess their fear of death and too</div><div><br></div><div>supercilious to acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness. their reflections on death exhibit</div><div><br></div><div>a hypocritical serenity; in fact, they tremble with fear more than anyone else. one should not forget that philosophy is the art of masking inner torments.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>The lack of questioning concerning the Ground of all things, as witnessed within both the scientific community and religious community is, yet, also found (maybe most astonishingly) in the philosophical community. The lack of the experience of Nihilism, the 'intellectualizing' and worldly perspective of most philosophers is obvious when one hears discussions on The Moral Argument for God's existence, Pascal's Wager, and the Allegory of the Cave, just to name a few instances.</div><div><br></div><div>Right away, in the first of these examples, it should be obvious that this is not to say that one must agree with the soundness of such an argument. Rather, it is that many philosophers do not grasp the ontology, or the ground, that such an argument is attempting to bring forth. The ontology of values is shown to be misunderstood when there is an epistemological response of: “I can be a good person without God”. Knowing the Good, if there were such a thing, is different from the metaphysical grounding of the Good; to not be able to make a distinction between epistemology and ontology is another example of unthinking.</div><div><br></div><div>“No matter how educated you are, if you don't think intensely about death, you are a mere fool. A great scholar – if he is nothing but that – is inferior to an illiterate peasant haunted by final questions.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“...he who hasn’t experienced a full depression alone and over a long period of time— he is a child.” Ligotti quoting Jens Bjørneboe</div><div><br></div><div>“One who never thinks of the hour of his death cannot make really spiritual decisions during his life. He will never be anything more than a short-sighted opportunist whose decisions will have no lasting value.” Merton</div><div><br></div><div>If an observer hypothesizes death then, from that perspective, the observer has no vested interests in life and thus possible grounds for the most objective view. The more an observer is reduced to nothing, the more the observer is no longer a factor, the more the observer might set the conditions for the most rigorous objectivity...It is likely that most people will not even consider the veracity of this correlation between death and objectivity even if they understand it intellectually because most will consciously or unconsciously choose to place the interests of self-preservation over the interests of objectivity. In other words, to even consider the validity of this view assumes that one is willing and able to even consider prioritizing objectivity over one’s own self-preservation. Since it not safe to simply assume this on an individual level, let alone a social level, relatively few are willing and able to seriously address this issue (and majority consensus can be expected to dismiss the issue). In short, for most people, including most “scientists”, overcoming self-preservation is not ultimately a subject for rational debate and objective discussion.” Heisman</div><div><br></div><div>The nightmare of existence that Pascal describes so vividly, with his unrelenting claims of the utter futility of reason, as he prefaces his 'wager' is inevitably turned into some strange sort of math equation concerning probabilities. I believe a quote, at length, from Pascal is not only worthy, but necessary, since it reiterates this point directly, and also lays the groundwork for the need for a further development of a Nihilistic language...</div><div><br></div><div>“And if besides this he is easy and content, professes to be so, and indeed boasts of it; if it is this state itself which is the subject of his joy and vanity, I have no words to describe so silly a creature. How can people hold these opinions? What joy can we find in the expectation of nothing but hopeless misery? What reason for boasting that we are in impenetrable darkness? And how can it happen that the following argument occurs to a reasonable man? "I know not who put me into the world, nor what the world is, nor what I myself am. I am in terrible ignorance of everything. I know not what my body is, nor my senses, nor my soul, not even that part of me which thinks what I say, which reflects on all and on itself, and knows itself no more than the rest. I see those frightful spaces of the universe which surround me, and I find myself tied to one corner of this vast expanse, without knowing why I am put in this place rather than in another, nor why the short time which is given me to live is assigned to me at this point rather than at another of the whole eternity which was before me or which shall come after me. I see nothing but infinites on all sides, which surround me as an atom, and as a shadow which endures only for an instant and returns no more. All I know is that I must soon die, but what I know least is this very death which I cannot escape...Such is my state, full of weakness and uncertainty. And from all this I conclude that I ought to spend all the days of my life without caring to inquire into what must happen to me. Perhaps I might find some solution to my doubts, but I will not take the trouble, nor take a step to seek it; and after treating with scorn those who are concerned with this care, I will go without foresight and without fear to try the great event, and let myself be led carelessly to death, uncertain of the eternity of my future state." Who would desire to have for a friend a man who talks in this fashion?”</div><div><br></div><div>This is Pascal's Wager. The 'intellectuals' who mutate Pascal's insights into the human condition into a strange math problem concerning probabilities misses the entire environment in which the wager is put forth. This is not a casual decision made from acute calculations of 'finite losses' and 'infinite gains'. That is propaganda language on Pascal's part. As you can see from his own words above, all finitudes fall under the category of 'lost'. There are no winners here. One cannot find what one is looking for in this nightmarish existence. This is Pascal's Wager.</div><div><br></div><div>Another example is Plato's Allegory of the Cave when it is taken as no more than 'myth' that has no direct correlation to reality and seen with no more 'validity' than any another story contained within a 'religious' text. For instance, with reference to Plato's Cave, the same can be said about roller-coasters. Imagine there is a builder who constructs a roller-coaster. The builder, however, never actually steps foot on the ride. If one was to ask the builder what his roller-coaster was like, what an experience of riding the roller-coaster was like, any attempt to explain the experience, regardless of the builder's knowledge of every dip, turn, curve, and flip, would lack any particular substance.</div><div><br></div><div>This is the exact situation most philosophers are in when they speak of Plato's Cave as 'only' a 'myth', while up at their 'prestigious' lecterns. Their lack of direct experience turns any words spewed out to be covered in ignorance at best, and dogmatism at worst. This is an empirical example of how the worldly, materialistic thinking has affected even the ones who are supposed to be the 'questioners of truth' on its deepest levels</div><div><br></div><div>As we will see when we come to our fuller discussion of mysticism and Entheogenic experiences, the cave allegory, as a transcendent reality, is not the type of thing that is 'believed in' or to be taken as a mere metaphor, rather it is something to be experienced first hand. When used in the proper set (environment) and setting (proper psychological preparation for participation in the experience of the Other) an uncanny world opens up that leaves any naturalistic interpretation feeling inadequate, if not utterly wrongheaded. Without making claims about the mystical-type experience 'proving' a Transcendent reality, there is a correlation between the experience and the knower that may be useful for our purposes.</div><div><br></div><div>This sentiment may be able to be made more clear with a mentioning of 'uncanniness'. The feeling that one is 'at home' here in the world is one that is the most common view of human experience. The casual nature in which humans scurry from one project to the next, one pursuit of 'happiness' after another, is the way the world operates on the whole. The question that a philosopher might ask is something along these lines: what is there to be 'casual' about with regards to flying around on a rock at 40,000 miles an hour, around a fireball 'about' to explode causing utter annihilation, in the 'middle' of a possibly endless void, in a possible infinitude of space and time?</div><div><br></div><div>That there are 'miles per hour', that there are physical 'things', that one has hands to type, made of what we refer to as 'flesh', and on and on...these are all assumptions taken as 'normal'. That you are reading these words and that they are impregnating your brain immediately as each word, one after the other, is read. Put simply, there is nothing to be casual about. Zapffe finds this 'casualness' counter to the fundamental human condition. He writes: “Such a ‘feeling of cosmic panic’ is pivotal to every human mind.” Conversely, a fleeing from such panic, without any questioning of a deeper “Why?', is also 'pivotal' to every human mind.</div><div><br></div><div>In the life-story of Buddha, one hears Kierkegaard's echo: "Oh worldly men! how fatally deluded! beholding everywhere the body brought to dust, yet everywhere the more carelessly living; the heart is neither lifeless wood nor stone, and yet it thinks not 'all is vanishing!'" Then turning, he directed his chariot to go back, and no longer waste his time in wandering. How could he, whilst in fear of instant death, go wandering here and there with lightened heart!”</div><div><br></div><div>“Certain facts of which too keen a perception would act detrimentally to the life-force are, for most men, impossible of realization: i.e. , the uncertainty of life, the decay of the body, the vanity of all things under the sun. When we are in good health, we all feel very real, solid, and permanent; and this is of all our illusions the most ridiculous, and also the most obviously useful from the point of view of the efficiency and preservation of the race.” Underhill</div><div><br></div><div>To overcome would be to be a god. Nietzsche's Uberman, Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith, Heidegger's Equanimity, Vivekananda's wholly unselfish being, all are ideals that cannot be reached, at least in the form of which human beings presently exist. The mystics also attempt to claim a 'reconciliation', but this is only done in the possibility of forgetting the human situation in their fleeting moments of ecstasy. Regardless of the validity of mystical-type experiences, which do seem to hold as a foundational element of human experience, these experiences are drowned in the experience of Nihilism. Meaninglessness subsumes mysticism. Tillich expresses this precisely as an aspect of his philosophy: “The experience of meaninglessness is more radical than mysticism. Therefore it transcends the mystical experience.”</div><div><br></div><div>Tillich, with all his comprehensive words on Nihilism, is still working within his brand of Christianity. This undue emphasis on worldly 'courage', both by himself and his readers, comes off, at best, as suspect. Is Tillich's worldly conception of 'courage' only to be held by those who have only either 'intellectualized' Nihilism or who are attempting to flee it? Tillich's own words suggest something is being lost in translation when he describes the role of meaninglessness as fundamental to the 'meaning of life':</div><div><br></div><div>“The answer must accept, as its precondition, the state of meaninglessness. It is not an answer if it demands the removal of this state; for that is just what cannot be done. He who is in the grip of doubt and meaninglessness cannot liberate himself from this grip but he asks for an answer which is valid within and not outside the situation of despair. He asks for the ultimate foundation of what we have called the 'courage of despair.' There is only one possible answer, if one does not try to escape the question; namely that the acceptance of despair is in itself faith. In this situation the meaning of life is reduced to despair about the meaning of life.”</div><div><br></div><div>How does one square an emphasis on 'courage' with the rest of Tillich's philosophy that is built, one could argue entirely, upon despair and meaninglessness, as anything more than a conjuring illusion for everyday people? Does Tillich believe his own words? Is Tillich preaching a 'happy' message for the masses, instead of a 'truth' that he in the end holds to? As he was preaching 'courage', did he forget the Protestant King's words? “God forbid! Even if God were to offer me paradise in order that I might last forty more years in this life, I wouldn't want it. I'd rather hire a hangman to knock my head off. That's how bad the world is now. It's full of nothing but devils, so that one can't with anything better than a blessed end and to get away. Nor do I bother with physicians.”</div><div><br></div><div>And how about Vivekananda, who Tillich shares a great part of his philosophy with? “I hate this world, this dream, this horrible nightmare with its churches and chicaneries, its books and blackguardisms, its fair faces and false hearts, its howling righteousness on the surface and utter hollowness beneath, and, above all, its sanctified shopkeeping.” Does Tillich actually believe that this 'courage' of facing the necessary idolatrous nature of concrete religious symbols takes priority over suicide? Is this just a facade or another example of fleeing from Nihilism? Does he truly believe in it? Or, even if all are touched by the Nihilistic experience, however lightly, is he preaching to the masses who are mostly ignorantly fleeing from the experience of Nothingness?</div><div><br></div><div>“See how we are flying like hunted hares from all that is terrible, and like them, hiding our heads and thinking we are safe. See how the whole world is flying from everything terrible.” Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>Ultimate skepticism and doubt are built in to the syntax of Nihilism, even in the instances of those few who have experienced something mystical and wish to interpret their experience as Transcendent. This interpretation of Nihilism is essentially locked into the human situation which is, at least in part, naturalistic. Even if one is let out of this 'prison-house' for a short period of recreation, one must be thrown back into the cell of the Nothing of the world; this is until death allows for a full escape into the Nothingness. As Pascal realized: “scepticism helps religion.”</div><div><br></div><div>“If you believe in God, you are mad without having gone mad.” Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>“Those who believe that they believe in God, but without any passion in their heart, without anguish of mind, without uncertainty, without doubt, without an element of despair even in their consolation, believe only in the God-Idea, not in God Himself.” Unamuno</div><div><br></div><div>'Who wants God? That is the question. Do you think the mass of people in the world want God and cannot get him? That cannot be...A disciple went to his master and said to him, "Sir, I want religion." The master looked at the young man, and did not speak, but only smiled. The young man came every day, and insisted that he wanted religion. But the old man knew better than the young man. One day, when it was very hot, he asked the young man to go to the river with him and take a plunge. The young man plunged in, and the old man followed him and held the young man down under the water by force. After the young man had struggled for a while, he let him go and asked him what he wanted most while he was under the water. "A breath of air", the disciple answered. "Do you want God in that way? If you do, you will get Him in a moment," said the master. Until you have that thirst, that desire, you cannot get religion, however you may struggle with your intellect, or your books, or your forms. Until that thirst is awakened in you, you are no better than any atheist; only the atheist is sincere, and you are not.” Vivekananda<hr></div><div><h1>Extra Notes and Quotes<br></h1></div><div><br></div><div>“The burden is not a local one, peculiar to those first hearers, but one which is borne by the whole human race. It consists not of political oppression or poverty or hard work. It is far deeper than that. It is felt by the rich as well as the poor for it is something from which wealth and idleness can never deliver us. The burden borne by mankind is a heavy and crushing thing.” Tozer</div><div><br></div><div>“You may do good works all the time. All the same, you will be the slave of your senses, you will be miserable and unhappy. You may study the philosophy of every religion. Men in this country carry loads and loads of books on their backs. They are mere scholars, slaves of the senses, and therefore happy and unhappy. They read two thousand books, and that is all right; but as soon as a little misery comes, they are worried, anxious.... You call yourselves men! You stand up ... and build hospitals. You are fools!” Swami Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>“There is so much said now about people being offended at Christianity because it is so dark and gloomy, offended at it because it is so severe, etc. It is now high time to explain that the real reason why man is offended at Christianity is because it is too high, because its goal is not man’s goal, because it would make of a man something so extraordinary that he is unable to get it into his head.” Kierkegaard</div><div><br></div><div>“...anxiety- the stirring of the creature between the realms of plantlike security and spiritual risk.” Buber</div><div><a title="#Nihiltheism" data-upnote-tag="#Nihiltheism" spellcheck="false" data-non-editable="true" href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=Nihiltheism">#Nihiltheism</a>&nbsp;<a title="#naturalism" data-upnote-tag="#naturalism" spellcheck="false" data-non-editable="true" href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=naturalism">#naturalism</a></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb" data-note-id="3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb" data-non-editable="true">The Religious Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f" data-note-id="9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f" data-non-editable="true">-Nihilism Preface-</a></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5" data-note-id="31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5" data-non-editable="true">The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384" data-note-id="4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384" data-non-editable="true">The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism</a></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9" data-note-id="397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9" data-non-editable="true">Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other</a></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3" data-note-id="fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3" data-non-editable="true">The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness</a></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0" data-note-id="aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0" data-non-editable="true">The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing</a></div></div></div></div></body>

Madness and death can be driven away temporarily, but they will return, and, having returned, will carry out their purpose: they will ask man questions which he would rather forget forever.” Shestov<br><br><br>I believe that those who speculate that a full apprehension of man’s condition would drive him insane are right, quite literally right.” Becker<br><br><br>“Human cowardice, as Kierkegaard said more than once, cannot endure what madness and death have to tell us.” Shestov<br><br><br>“A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it.” Camus<br><br><br>“The situation becomes farcical only when the hobby-man attempts to “unsick” the lifetime devoted philosopher, to cure him, as it were, of being insalubriously pessimistic!” Herman Tonseman<br><br>“In life, man proposes, God disposes.” Huxley (Kempus)<br><br><br>“Now more than ever, we should build monasteries...for those who believe in everything and for those who believe in nothing. Where to escape? There no longer exists a single place where we can professionally execrate this world.” Cioran<br><br><br>“Thus I, a healthy and a happy man, was brought to feel that I could live no longer, that an irresistible force was dragging me down into the grave.” Tolstoy<br><br><br>“We have invented happiness.” Nietzsche<br><br><br>“Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness.” Pascal<br><br><br>“...the ascetic ideal has meant so much to man, lies expressed the fundamental feature of man's will, his horror vacui \[horror of a vacuum\]: he needs a goal - and he will sooner will nothingness than not will at all. - Am I not understood? - Have I not been understood? - "Certainly not, sir?" - Well, let us begin at the beginning.” Nietzsche<br><br><br>“Thinking of God and not religion, of ecstasy and not mysticism. The difference between the theoretician of faith and the believer is as great as between the psychiatrist and the psychotic.” (my emphasis)<br><br><br>These words by Cioran lay out the mindset of this entire work. The rejection of the worldly is one that is necessary for these words to have any resonance, yet it is the most difficult position to comprehend; the experience of Nothing is so rare.<br><br><br>“...under the ascendancy of falling and publicness, ‘real’ anxiety is rare.” Heidegger<br><br><br>"if no-thing originally becomes manifest only in dread, must we not then remain permanently suspended in this dread in order to be able to exist at all? Yet have we ourselves not already admitted that this original dread is rare?" Heidegger<br><br><br>"One problem: Human beings are rarely so sensitive to the woes of this world that they feel a pressing need to reject all cravings for the pleasures of this world, as Buddhism would have them do. And it seems that any amount of pleasure is pleasure enough to get us to keep the faith that being alive is all right for everyone, or almost everyone, and will certainly be all right for any children we cause to be delivered into this world.”&nbsp;Ligotti<br><br><br>“Vanity.—How wonderful it is that a thing so evident as the vanity of the world is so little known, that it is a strange and surprising thing to say that it is foolish to seek greatness!”&nbsp;Pascal (Vivekananda speaks of the rarity of the Nihilistic belief, Kierkegaard, Ligotti, Cioran, Otto \['recently read'- about six years ago now- 10/11/23\], all state about the rare instances of this 'true' religious experience)<br><br><br>Nihilism must be properly distinguished from mental illness and, more specifically, from being represented in some form of worldliness. Although there is much more that needs to be said regarding this issue, the sentiment can at least be acknowledged in the words of Becker: “Full humanness means full fear and trembling, at least some of the waking day...When you get a person to look at the sun as it bakes down on the daily carnage taking place on earth, the ridiculous accidents, the utter fragility of life, the powerlessness of those he thought most powerful—what comfort can you give him from a psychotherapeutic point of view?”&nbsp;<br><br><br>Fr. Seraphim Rose expresses the distinction this way: “Nihilism is, most profoundly, a spiritual disorder, and it can be overcome only by spiritual means; and there has been no attempt whatever in the contemporary world to apply such means.”<br><br><br>Mitchell Heisman also damns any attempt at relating psychology or 'religion' to Nihilism. Nihilism expresses the fundamental, 'incurable' ground of the human condition:<br><br><br>“Can the meaninglessness of existence be cured with therapy? Lie therapy, whether religious or secular, is overwhelmingly the normative state of the human race. Put another way, there may be sound psychological reasons why radical nihilism is not a condition prescribed by therapists. Yet if psychologists are scientists, and their own methodology confirms the scientific view of human beings as material things in motion, on what grounds can they criticize nihilism in itself? Only insofar as psychologists are not scientists; insofar as they are non-objective partisans of the ‘life party’, psychologists fundamentally are irrevocably biased against consideration of my point of view. Psychological explanations can be used, not only to evade the nihilistic, but to evade the scientific equation of the larger material world with a material view of one’s own mind — and thus to misunderstand the problem.”<br><br><br>How does madness and suicide relate to Nihilism? Are madness and suicide necessary consequences of Nihilism? If madness is related to Nihilism, is it to be welcomed, or even pursued? Is there a difference between a worldly suicide and a suicide resulting from Nihilism? Is there a difference of a particular 'irrational' neurosis and the terror that comes from the insights of an experience of Nihilism?<br><br><br>There is one well-documented case. of suicide due to Nihilism in the writing of Mitchell Heisman who lived out Nihilism to a end . seemingly, in its lack of Transcendence. Heisman asks: “Can one live a philosophy of the nihilistic, reconciling meaninglessness with every thought and emotion at every moment? If active unbelief were the highest organizing principle of a life, would the consequence be rational self-destruction? Could suicide represent the pinnacle of the rational life realized?” His suicide suggests the impossibility of such an existence; or rather the utter rationality of suicide in a non-rational world.<br><br><br>In his two-thousand page suicide note, Heisman expresses a propulsion towards a new language of Nihilism that though he may have been seeking after, he could not find. He describes his ambitions accordingly: “The implications of life’s meaninglessness have not been elicited with sufficient ruthlessness. My methodology is honesty to the point of absurdity; honesty without mercy; honesty unprejudiced by morals, aesthetics, faith, or hope. When all illusions have been dispelled, at the end of overcoming subjectivities, biases, and prejudices towards life, one encounters the possibility of rational negation of self-interest; rational self-annihilation; rational self-destruction. The experiment in nihilism is to seek out precisely those truths that are most deadly and destructive to me. To will death through truth and truth through death.” ('possibility' of rational self-destruction? Ha! Isn't that adorable?)<br><br><br>Underhill, a hundred-years earlier, describes the seemingly necessary nature of an undertaking such that Heisman pursued: “But the true intellectualist, who concedes nothing to instinct or emotion, is obliged in the end to adopt some form of sceptical philosophy. The horrors of nihilism, in fact, can only be escaped by the exercise of faith...” All the same, Heisman lacked such a applicable language of 'faith'. Is there anything behind this thought that drives two thinkers, as seemingly as diverse as Heisman and Underhill, that has been forgotten amongst the busyness of the world, which suggests something fundamental about the human condition?<br><br><br>Moreover, there is the issue of whether 'something' is missing in Heisman's interpretation of Nihilism or whether Underhill is 'guilty' of falling pray to the fear of an uncompromising Nihilism. One is driven to 'faith' ('faith' here is used in relation to the Nothing of the world, 'beyond good and evil', beyond a human morality. One of the most accurate definitions of 'faith' in relation to Nothingness comes from Kierkegaard: “...the opposite of sin is not virtue but faith.” 'Faith' is the experience of something 'beyond' the Nothingness of the world) and the other to suicide. Does one of them one of have a fuller conception of Nihilism? Is one of them 'right'?<br><br><br>Throughout Heisman's expansive suicide note one finds it replete with many other sentiments that have been put forth by both 'saints' and other 'religiously' minded people, although stated in a wholly naturalistic interpretation of a Nihilism that lacks any notion of Transcendence. Heisman speaks of denying the self, the wretchedness of human life, the contradictory nature of human emotions, the nothing of the world, a possible transcendental aspect of human consciousness (which he found in the music of Bach), yet the saints lived out their lives under an umbrella of a religious language (regardless of how porous the umbrella), while Heisman was drowned in the naturalistic language of the 21st century. Nihilism is all-powerful in its experience, regardless of the human limitations of interpretation.<br><br><br>And even though he expresses, at least in part, some desire to move past a strictly naturalist viewpoint, he was unable to do so. The following quote from Heisman shows at least a hint for the possibility of a language that moves Nihilism past a wholly-naturalistic view, while not entirely escaping its grasp. Worth mentioning is that we shouldn't take what Heisman has to say here in its simplest form, which is tempting to do with the words that he has chosen (reducing his 'discovery' down to an 'evolutionary basis), i.e. the common criticism of 'God' as arising from some pragmatic function which stems from a place of 'desperation', as a need for an 'escape' from the human condition. This would be to miss the deeper interpretation of grounding 'God' within and essentially as Nihilism, rather than as an answer derived for comfort or as some sort of 'conclusion to the problem'.<br><br><br>“When all choices are equal, equality is compatible with total randomness. If all choices are equal, then the choice of death is equal to the choice of life. If life is meaningless, then God is nothing. But a funny thing happened on the way to nihilistic self-destruction. It was precisely through radical disbelief that I discovered an evolutionary basis for God. Most secular people in the West are simply not ruthless enough in their nihilism to vivisect belief to death. Yet vivisecting belief to death exposes how the original monotheistic conception of God likely arose out of ruthless realism. Monotheism may have originated out of a skeptical, nihilistic, materialistic objectivity that annihilated the biologically based subjectivity of the self, and thus created something ‘out of nothing’.”<br><br><br>Now, this is not to say that Heisman was necessarily 'wrong' in his action of suicide, that he should have been saved, or that even a Nihilistic language that I am envisioning could have stopped his suicide. The question is: is suicide the answer? Would a language that encompassed and embraced the kindred words of Heisman and the saints allow for Heisman to live as a saint? (Does one even want to live as a saint?) Conversely, would a Nihilistic language/symbolism/method/etc. entail suicide?<br><br><br>The Suicide is not one to be judged in any particular manner. There is a question of how to think about the suicide of the businessman who just lost his job or the person who has just been broken up with by the 'love of their life' and the Nihilist engulfed in Nothingness. Is there such a thing as an authentic suicide? Is the suicide of the one who has lost a (all) 'worldly' distraction(s) that they relate their 'entire' selves to the same as a Heisman who has already discovered the Nothing of the world? The person who is a slave to the world seemingly has a slight 'opening up' of Nihilism with the destruction of what they hold as meaningful, with the loss of a job or a relationship, for instance, yet they seem to flee into suicide as a relief. (I don't like this last sentence)<br><br><br>But what about the one who has experienced Nihilism and knows that the material positions, even the 'person to person' connections/interactions are inevitably the iquevalent to the walking dead? These worldly groundings have already died for the Nihilist. Do we stop the worldly suicide and not the Nihilistic suicide? If one has not experienced the death of the world, then can that person be dragged back into the world, talked off of the ledge? Conversely, if the world has died for a person, and everything within the world is insignificant (Heidegger, obviously), then what is there to drag such a person back to? Is the development of a Nihilistic language of transcendence even 'worth' the effort?</div><div><br>Is the Nihilistic suicide not the 'optimal' set of movements? Is the Nihilistic suicide authentic in the sense that it is not a 'fleeing' or escaping from the world, but rather a movement that is the inevitable decision to release oneself into the Divine? The strange aversion to one following the 'logic of suicide' is almost as universal as the unquestioned following of the 'logic of life'.<br><br>“When a human being takes his life in depression, this is a natural death of spiritual causes. The modern barbarity of ‘saving’ the suicidal is based on a hair-raising misapprehension of the nature of existence.” Zapffe<br><br>The issue is way more complex than this black and white illustration. The 'jumping' suicides of 9/11 are one such example of the complexity of 'suicide'; there is a possibility that these are not even 'suicides' in any 'real' sense. With that said, there does seem to be something missing from the common suicide that is not lacking in Heisman's. This 'something' seems to be that the common suicide is worldly and concerned with the ego, rather than the transcendent-self (although one could forcefully argue that Heisman was driven by his ego). This distinction of suicides, and the mindsets and motivations, can be interpreted in a similar way via Kierkegaard:<br><br>“It is almost as though the Christian must be puffed up because of this proud elevation above everything men commonly call misfortune, above that which men commonly call the greatest evil. But then in turn Christianity has discovered an evil which man as such does not know of; this misery is the sickness unto death. What the natural man considers horrible -- when he has in this wise enumerated everything and knows nothing more he can mention, this for the Christian is like a jest.&nbsp;<br><br>Such is the relation between the natural man and the Christian; it is like the relation between a child and a man: what the child shudders at, the man regards as nothing. The child does not know what the dreadful is; this the man knows, and he shudders at it. The child's imperfection consists, first of all, in not knowing what the dreadful is; and then again, as an implication of this, in shuddering at that which is not dreadful. And so it is also with the natural man, he is ignorant of what the dreadful truly is, yet he is not thereby exempted from shuddering; no, he shudders at that which is not the dreadful: he does not know the true God, but this is not the whole of it, he worships an idol as God.”<br><br>The one who ‘sees’ the Nothing of the world can no longer find any interest in it. This or that activity is received as a distraction from this Other, this sensation of a constantly being picked at; in naturalistic terms one would refer to it as the incessant nagging from one's conscience.<br><br>When one experiences the meaninglessness of the world, one becomes intoxicated by it, becoming the All that one wishes to surround themselves with. And for a short moment, one does not yet fully grasp that the Nothingness of existence is no longer voluntary for one to pursue or not. There just is Nothing left, it's all been shattered by the experience. Although I dislike Camus and his pathetic excuse for a "solution" or " answer" to the unsolvable, and I'm not convinced he didn't simply settle on &nbsp;such a cliché response to Nihilism, as to not get recognition and fame. Regardless, he did say one thing that was true: Once one is aware of the Absurd, there's no going back. It's here, it's now, it's everything, and everyone, every word, every sound, the bizarre, just absolute ridiculousness of whatever this is... @ The patchwork is no longer a working option, as it is for the almost entirety of the human species. Most people are trying, carrying their buckets of water from the river to the campground, and Some people's buckets only have a sliver hairline crack running down the side, or maybe the tiniest of hole starting to develop, but then there's another who has some more damage, a few cracks and leaks, but they can still work with the bucket, it's not out of commission, by any stretch of the imagination. However, meanwhile, there are those whose buckets are completely dilapidated. The one with the fewest points of leakage is able to hold onto their water, to follow through with their life, and do so quite easily, as their ‘bucket’ has barely a dent. This is how most people seem to get through life, utterly blind of their condition, of the chasm of death whose opening awaits every step, thought, and breath.<br><br>The person who has a few more holes in his bucket is grasping to hold on, trying ever so hard to get at least some of the water back to the campground, yet he may not make it. And if he does make it back to the campground, before he can rejoice, he looks down to see not even a mouthful left in bucket. This person was so frantic and panicked about getting at least some of the water back, that they lost any perception of the water in the bucket, the main purpose of everything: the journey, the hurrying, the panic, and yet they got so caught up with a distraction that if they hadn’t been in a state of being where existence was being veiled, by this or that thing, they would have noticed, much, much sooner before making it back to the campground, that their bucket was empty, their attempt, futile. The one in this state of being seems to stand hardly a chance.<br><br>{{{Is there an authenticity in the final person 'giving up'? (I don't know if I like this, I'll have to reread).}}}<br><br>There are people who are existing within this awareness, struggling to keep themselves distracted, yet knowing that something is wrong, that the water is leaking, that the bucket is drying up. The attempts to maintain a sense of meaning, value and purpose, within the finite, and through the necessarily nonsensical nature of objects that it’s comprised of, such as their work, wealth, family, hobbies, passions, hates, etc. They feel a sense of dissatisfaction, yet they keep plugging along in what they halfway recognize, yet refuse to accept, as a necessary failure.<br><br><i>All the water, from all the buckets, will eventually be lost.</i><br><br>Then there are those with buckets so dilapidated that they run with fervor back to the campground with a beyond obvious empty bucket, they may even brag or make comments about how much water they are able to transport, and how they will be revered as such a great help, miracle-worker, savior, or simply a trustworthy, reliable companion. These people are schizophrenics, the mentally handicapped, the deterministic material objects that make no sense as to anything but to demand the pity from others, for no other reason than for existing, for simply ‘being here’. The task of feeding oneself becomes the apex of human accomplishment, rather than the waste of time that it so obviously is. The fallacious sense of ‘purpose’ that this deterministic existence gives to the caregiver can be both a burden, and yet also the distraction of hope that one could not live without. The assumptions of ‘doing good’, of ‘never giving up’, and so forth are more cliché catchphrases that if honestly looked at, could not possibly stand on the definitions that people give them in order to mask the Nothingness of existence. These people cannot be held up by any of life's distractions anymore. Everything has slipped through their fingers. All meaning has left the temporal realm.<br><br>“When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.” Kierkegaard<br><br>“i want to die but I am sorry that I want to die. this is the feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness.” Cioran<br><br>“He points to those who 'do not want to live and do not know how to die.'” Tillich quoting Seneca<br><br>There is a dichotomy between the logic of life and the logic of suicide. One will always speak past the other. There is no communicating the logic of suicide to one who has not even questioned, never mind experienced the Nothing of existence; the experience of Nothingness is not within their frame of reference. The vast majority of the human species follows the logic of life. They feel at home here in the world; there is nothing to worry about here. The one who has been brought to Nothingness has no way of 'arguing' away the 'meaning' put onto the lives of those within the world.<br><br>“Psychiatry even works on the assumption that the ‘healthy’ and viable is at one with the highest in personal terms. Depression, ‘fear of life,’ refusal of nourishment and so on are invariably taken as signs of a pathological state and treated thereafter. Often, however, such phenomena are messages from a deeper, more immediate sense of life, bitter fruits of a geniality of thought or feeling at the root of antibiological tendencies. It is not the soul being sick, but its protection failing, or else being rejected because it is experienced – correctly – as a betrayal of ego’s highest potential.” Zapffe<br><br>Is there even any point to ask why others are so uncomfortable with thinking?! Reason leads you to skepticism. Skepticism brings you to despair. Despair drives you to Nihilism. Nihilism opens up the Other. The Other is terrifyingly strange. My misery seems unbearable at best. What is this feeling of meaninglessness, if not Divine? What could possibly cause this experience? The fear of madness is one hindrance along the path to the Other; how demanding 'thinking' can be. Wouldn't to be stolen by madness be the realization of an ideal? Or why not the 'never-ending' adventure into madness?<br><br>“Humanly speaking, he is mad and cannot make himself understandable to anyone. And yet 'to be mad' is the mildest expression. If he is not viewed in this way, then he is a hypocrite, and the higher he ascends this path, the more appalling a hypocrite he is.” Kierkegaard<br><br>“He stands outside human concerns and draws close to the divine; ordinary people think he is disturbed and rebuke him for this, unaware that he is possessed by god...he would like to fly away, but he cannot; he is like a bird fluttering and looking upward and careless of the world below; and he is therefore thought to be mad.” Plato<br><br>St. Francis de Sales warns of the consequences that come from the world when one takes on a 'journey' such as Heisman's: “DIRECTLY that your worldly friends perceive that you aim at leading a devout life, they will let loose endless shafts of mockery and misrepresentation upon you; the more malicious will attribute your change to hypocrisy, designing, or bigotry; they will affirm that the world having looked coldly upon you, failing its favour you turn to God; while your friends will make a series of what, from their point of view, are prudent and charitable remonstrances. They will tell you that you are growing morbid; that you will lose your worldly credit, and will make yourself unacceptable to the world; they will prognosticate your premature old age, the ruin of your material prosperity; they will tell you that in the world you must live as the world does; that you can be saved without all this fuss; and much more of the like nature.”<br><br>And then, as if to mock them back, St. Francis calls out what he sees as their superficiality or unthinking:<br><br>&nbsp;“We have all seen men, and women too, pass the whole night, even several in succession, playing at chess or cards; and what can be a more dismal, unwholesome thing than that? But the world has not a word to say against it, and their friends are nowise troubled. But give up an hour to meditation, or get up rather earlier than usual to prepare for Holy Communion, and they will send for the doctor to cure you of hypochondria or jaundice!”<br><br>Elsewhere, he puts the disaster of an unthinking life that ought to resonate with anyone who considers themselves 'human':&nbsp;<br><br>“Again, while you were dancing, many a soul has passed away amid sharp sufferings; thousands and tens of thousands were lying all the while on beds of anguish, some perhaps untended, unconsoled, in fevers, and all manner of painful diseases. Will you not rouse yourself to a sense of pity for them? At all events, remember that a day will come when you in your turn will lie on your bed of sickness, while others dance and make merry.”<br><br>“Moreover, it is largely customary to mock at the melancholy; and in good society it is an unwritten law that every one shall bring a certain quota of contentment and gayety, or else remain in chambered solitude.” Saltus<br><br>Suicide need not be necessary even when it is not taken as an abomination. The indefinite, 'constructive' nature of the content that is found within Nihilism is something that is easily 'confused' due to its unknowability. One may be brought to suicide, yet it may bring another to a 'Some-thing'.<br><br>“...how do you fill out an empty life? With women, books, or worldly ambitions? No matter what you do, the starting point is boredom, and the end self-destruction.” Cioran<br><br>“To find that everything lacks reality and not to put an end to it all, this inconsistency is not an inconsistency at all: taken to extremes, the perception of the void coincides with the perception of the whole, with the entrance into the All.” Cioran<br><br>* * *<br><br>  <br><br>* * *<br><br># Extra Notes and Quotes<br><br>Vivekananda- “The true lovers of God want to become mad, inebriated with the love of God, to become 'God-intoxicated men'.”<br><br>If I had only to learn how an apple falls to the ground, or how an electric current shakes my nerves, I would commit suicide. I want to understand the heart of things, the very kernel itself...I want the why of everything, I leave the how to children.”<br><br>Swami Vivekananda. Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda (Kindle Locations 11429-11430). Kindle Edition.<br><br>Plato/Socrates- “I 230 am still unable, as the Delphic inscription orders, to know myself; and it really seems to me ridiculous to look into other things before I have understood that. This is why I do not concern myself with them. \[ accept what is generally believed, and, as I was just saying, I look not into them but into my own self.”<br><br>“For a madman is also a man whom society did not want to hear and whom it wanted to prevent from uttering certain intolerable truths.” Antonin Artaud<br><br>Grey and Koestler- “Both felt that solitude enhanced their appreciation of, and sympathy with, their fellow man. Both had intense experiences of feeling that some kind of higher order of reality existed with which solitude put then in touch. Both felt that trying to put this experience into words tended to trivialize it, because words could not really express it. Although neither man subscribed to any orthodox religious belief, both agreed that they had felt the abstract existence of something which was indefinable or which could only be expressed in symbols...he had also become more aware of horrors lurking under the surface...'feeling of inner freedom, of being alone and confronted with ultimate realities instead of with your bank statement. Your bank statement and other trivialities are again a kind of confinement. Not in space but in spiritual space...So you have got a dialogue with existence. A dialogue with life, a dialogue with death.' ...a courageous few discover that, when in hell, they are granted a glimpse of heaven.” Anthony Storr- Solitude<br><br><h1>Cioran-</h1><br>“i see a form of madness, not of knowledge, in the ecstasy of life's ultimate origins. You cannot experience it except in solitude, when you feel as if you were floating above the world. solitude is the proper milieu for madness. it is noteworthy that even the skeptic can experience this kind of ecstasy. does not the madness of ecstasy reveal itself through this odd combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair?”<br><br>“the truly awful thing in madness is that we sense a total and irrevocable loss of life while we are still living.”<br><br>“If you believe in God, you are mad without having gone mad.”<br><br>“As long as you are busy with him you have an excuse for sadness and solitude. God? An official madness.”<br><br><h1>End Cioran Quotes</h1><br>“If this introversion is absolutely maintained, omnibus numeris absoluta \[perfect in every respect\], then suicide will be the danger nearest to him. The common run of men have of course no presentiment of what such an introvert is capable of bearing; if they were to come to know it, they would be astonished. If on the other hand he talks to someone, if to one single man he opens his heart, he is in all probability strained to so high a tension, or so much let down, that suicide does not result from introversion. Such an introvert with one person privy to his thought is a whole tone milder than the absolute case. He probably will shun suicide. It may happen, however, that he falls into despair just for the fact that he has opened his heart to another; it may be that he thinks it would have been infinitely preferable to maintain silence rather than have anyone privy to his secret.” **Kierkegaard**<br><br>“Should I die in following the doctrine of Jesus? This question did not alarm me. It might seem frightful to any one who does not realize the nothingness and absurdity of an isolated personal life, and who believes that he will never die. But I know that my life, considered in relation to my individual happiness, is, taken by itself, a stupendous farce, and that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death.” **Tolstoy** (here Tolstoy seems to be saying nothing different from Heisman when one demythologizes 'Jesus' as an abstract ideal or experience, rather than some literal, miracle-working man in history)<br><br>  <br><br>“the revelation of death's immanence in life occurs during illnesses and long depressive states.<br><br>there are, of course, other ways, but they are accidental and individual, and do not have the same potential for revelation as illness or depression.” **Cioran**<br><br>“All my reasoning could not induce me to act in accordance with my convictions i.e., to kill myself. I should not speak the truth, if I said that my reason alone brought me to the position in which I was. Reason had been at work, no doubt, but something else had worked too, something which I can only call an instinctive consciousness of life.” **Tolstoy**<br><br>“To put briefly the facts against its being real: the ascetic ideal springs from the prophylactic and self-preservative instincts which mark a decadent life, which seeks by every means in its power to maintain its position and fight for its existence; it points to a partial physiological depression and exhaustion, against which the most profound and intact life-instincts fight ceaselessly with new weapons and discoveries. The ascetic ideal is such a weapon: its position is consequently exactly the reverse of that which the worshippers of the ideal imagine - life struggles in it and through it with death and against death; the ascetic ideal is a dodge for the preservation of life.” **Nietzsche**<br><br>“Away with this "perverse world"! Away with this shameful soddenness of sentiment! Preventing the sick making the healthy sick - for that is what such a soddenness comes to - this ought to be our supreme object in the world - but for this it is above all essential that the healthy should remain separated from the sick, that they should even guard themselves from the look of the sick, that they should not even associate with the sick.” Nietzsche<br><br>  <br><br>“...how do you fill out an empty life? With women, books, or worldly ambitions? No matter what you do, the starting point is boredom, and the end self-destruction.” Cioran<br><br>  <br><br>“The real question is not whether humanity is at the mercy of a pitiless world, but rather how we embody grace amid our own vacuity. When we heal our hearts by letting go of worldly concerns, we inevitably find our own void has been filled. Like ascetics who forsake the flesh in search of the spirit, we find our own salvation in the intrinsic flight from the mundane towards the sacred. This happens not on the outside, among the ruins of space and time, but hidden in the depths of the spirit where the external ceases to influence, an inversion into the profound abyss. There lies the bridge of transcendence; the end-object=nothingness.” Nietzsche</div><br></div></div></div></body>

The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously.” Heisman</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“To study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one’s self to die.”&nbsp; Cicero</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Only because no-thing is manifest at the heart of existence can the full strangeness of being come over us. Only if the strangeness of being impresses us does it waken us and open us up to wonder. Only on the basis of wonder, that is, the manifestness of no-thing, does the "Why?" come up.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The Nothing of the world must be seen through the filthiest of lenses.  The meaninglessness of human activity is found, not within a subjective value judgment, but rather in the ignorant finitude of all human activity.  The 'pushing forward' of most human mindsets is one that is built upon the ignorance of the experience of Nihilism.  Distractions and diversions are written into the language of 'normal' human beings.  What does one do when these distractions and diversions fail, when the natural mechanisms of consciousness that keep a human 'sane' break down? What does one do when one comes 'face to face' with Nihilism?  Is suicide a 'rational' option in the face of Nothingness?  Is there a 'path' that allows one to live alongside the Nothing?  Is the 'naked anxiety' found within human experience too much of a burden for one to endure, never mind pursue, in the constructing of a world-view?  Can one build a philosophy of religion based upon the Nothing of the world?  Beyond the question of 'possibility' with regards to constructing such a philosophy of religion, is there some demand to do so?  Does the Nihilistic experience contain any 'constructive' content that may allow itself to be interpreted as a 'religious' experience?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“All great conversions are born from the sudden revelation of life's meaninglessness.  Nothing could be more impressive than this sudden apprehension of the void of existence.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Humans are damned to philosophize, whether this is done in the unlearned fashion of the everyday person who is fooled into thinking he is 'free', 'smart', and 'comfortable' while in the chains of his cliches, or whether done in the style of the lofty analytic philosopher who believes that he is 'making a difference' when he puts on his suit and tie, stands up in front of a room of seven, and delivers his paper on 'counter-factuals'.   As it is practiced in the American Universities, philosophy has become seemingly nothing more than a fancy Sudoku puzzle used to satiate the boredom of 'intellectuals'.  The claims of Nihilism (taken in their overlapping declarations concerning the 'negative' status of moral, existential, epistemological, and metaphysical 'truths') have been dispelled, at best, as 'unanswerable', and at worst, as 'unworthy' for concern, within most of the analytical tradition.  Ultimate questions have been diminished into a clash of one incomplete argument against another.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“When he has not a book between his fingers he cannot think. When he thinks, he responds to a stimulus (a thought he has read),-finally all he does is to react. The scholar exhausts his whole strength in saying either " yes " or " no " to matter which has already been thought out, or in criticising it-he is no longer capable of thought on his own account. ... In him the instinct of self-defence has decayed, otherwise he would defend himself against books. The scholar is a decadent.”  Nietzsche</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Listen to a scholar speak; within the first few words, at best sentences, the name of another thinker will come out of their mouth.  They will then begin to sketch this thinker’s ideas or concepts.  They will then input some small amount of their own thoughts, that rarely constitute much more than a smearing around of the other thinker’s thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; The atheist philosopher's with their so-called 'problem of evil' act as if their rejection of a ‘god’, one that can be boxed into the finite human intellect, is somehow the 'intellectually superior' position while conveniently forgetting the fact that they themselves lack any non-pragmatic ground for trusting human reason within a wholly naturalistic worldview.  Why believe that your inductive inferences about 'God's existence' ought to be grounded purely in reason?  In other words, why be 'rational'?  Why value reason over Absurdity in an Ultimately purposeless universe that has no 'end' or goal?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“We are all atheists, and yet we try to fight the man who admits it. We are all in the dark; religion is to us a mere intellectual assent, a mere talk, a mere nothing. We often consider a man religious who can talk well. But this is not religion.”  Vivekananda&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;It is no better on the other side, where one finds 'religious' philosophers shelling out their hubris filled 'theodicies' in a pathetic effort to defend their small god by diminishing the Other into some conception of human 'oughts' or a self-satisfying version of skepticism that never goes far enough to stop all their babble about the Other. The scene is as pathetic, if so much so as to be comical, as to be equivalent to a sleep-walker, with a scalpel in his hand, strutting with confidence into the operating room 'ready' to perform surgery.  Philosophy does all this while working under the guise of a Socratic Method, yet without a mindset that even remotely resembles that of a Doubting Socrates.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Philosophy can never directly supply the forces and create the mechanisms and opportunities that bring about a historical state of affairs, if only because philosophy is always the direct concern of the few. Which few? The ones who transform creatively, who unsettle things.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Only the small begins small—the small, whole dubious greatness consists in diminishing everything...”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“To look upon healthier concepts and values from the standpoint of the sick, and conversely to look down upon the secret work of the instincts of decadence from the standpoint of him who is laden and self-reliant with the richness of life-this has been my longest exercise, my principal experience. If in anything at all, it was in this that I became a master.”  Nietzsche (The entire point of philosophy.  A position and its counter)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“First, I attack only things that are triumphant-if necessary I wait until they become triumphant. Secondly, I attack only those things against which I find no allies, against which I stand alone-against which I compromise nobody but myself...I have not yet taken one single step before the public eye, which did not compromise me: that is my criterion of a proper mode of action.”  Nietzsche&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Understanding has revealed to us that there is nowhere to flee from Nothingness.” Shestov</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Philosophy is hanging itself.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;This paradigm in philosophy, of the 'supremacy' of reason, is based upon a false interpretation of the Socratic Method that has been deformed by the positivistic, scientism style of thinking that philosopher's, disregarding Heidegger's warnings, attempt to 'follow' along distorting philosophy into a false counterpart of science.  Philosophers have ambitiously 'elevated' reason, as the sole characteristic of human beings that separates us from other animals, to an exaggerated degree.  Is the 'Socratic Method' to be used as a tool for knowledge or is it a way to open up the mystery of human existence?  Is this bizarre method of analytic philosophy the explanation for why philosophers are constantly talking past one another, cloaking philosophy into a 'rationalization' for beliefs that are held on other grounds besides 'reason'?  Whatever 'philosophy' actually is, if pursued honestly and fully, does it not lead to skepticism and doubt?  Does it not leave one with the question 'Why?'  Is philosophy's false 'elevation' of reason the drive behind the criticisms coming from the scientistic community?  The analytic tradition of philosophy is too distant from the existential conditions of man.  The 'intellectual' trappings on the philosophers have eliminated the direct experiences of certain forms of human consciousness, in turn giving these 'thinkers' the false impression that they are 'doing something' with their existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“yet other philosophies and doctrines say almost nothing about death.  the only valid attitude is absolute silence or a cry of despair.  some people maintain that the fear of death does not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i there is no death, and once dead there is no i any longer. these people have forgotten about the very strange phenomenon of gradual agony. what comfort does this artificial distinction between the i and death offer a man who has a strong premonition of death?  what meaning can logical argument or subtle thought have for someone deeply imbued with a feeling of the irrevocable? all attempts to bring existential questions onto a logical plane are null and void.  philosophers are too proud to confess their fear of death and too supercilious to acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness. their reflections on death exhibit a hypocritical serenity; in fact, they tremble with fear more than anyone else. one should not forget that philosophy is the art of masking inner torments.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;'Intellectual' notions of Nihilism are always stillborn.  No one knows what is going on here.  No one knows the 'Why?' to existence.  Why is it, then, that philosophers move forward with an attitude of self-assurance, in a purely pragmatic or worldly fashion, without any ground beneath them?  Why do they build these philosophical systems in the air?  Does the equivalent of a 'One has to live' tag-line suffice, amongst all the convoluted jargon, for today's philosophers?  Why not simply blow your brains out the back of your head?  Are the fleeting 'joys' and transitory 'attachments' of your life worth keeping you within the nightmare of human existence?</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“And the most tragic problem of philosophy is to reconcile intellectual necessities with the necessities of the heart and the will. For it is on this rock that every philosophy that pretends to resolve the eternal and tragic contradiction, the basis of our existence, breaks to pieces. But do all men face this contradiction squarely?”  Unamuno</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“only the organic and existential thinker is capable of this kind of seriousness, because truth for him is alive, born from inner agony and organic disorder rather than useless speculation. out of the shadow of the abstract man, who thinks for the pleasure of thinking, emerges the organic man, who thinks because of a vital imbalance, and who is beyond science and art.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Some people, it is true, can live contentedly with a philosophy of meaninglessness for a very long time.  But in most cases it will be found that these people possess some talent or accomplishment that permits them to live a life which, to a limited extent, is profoundly meaningful and valuable.  Thus an artist, or a man of science can profess a philosophy of general meaninglessness and yet lead a perfectly contented life...artistic creation and scientific research are absorbingly delightful occupations...They are proclaimed to be ends absolutely in themselves – ends so admirable that those who pursue them are excused from bothering about anything else.”  Huxley</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Schopenhauer wrote that “Philosophy can never do more than interpret and explain what is given.”  Philosophy is the unending 'Why?” in an attempt to open up the mystery of being, to reach out towards the ground of all things.  Philosophy lacks any authoritative, normative prescriptions in and of itself; philosophy is only concerned with the 'logical' consequences of a particular proposition, regardless of the ontology of any specific consequences or their starting point.  Philosophy, then, if it is to contribute anything to our project, must derive an analysis, or a 'map of consequences', that are drawn out and put into a new language that is grounded in the direct human experience of Nihilism.  This is the preambles of such a task. (Maybe this needs to be the opening paragraph)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“The mind is not to be ruffled by vain arguments, because argument will not help us to know God. It is a question of fact, and not of argument. All argument and reasoning must be based upon certain perceptions. Without these, there cannot be any argument. Reasoning is the method of comparison between certain facts which we have already perceived.”  Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Does philosophy, as defined, therefore, have any contribution to make concerning the experience of Nihilism?  Our 'philosophy' is not a series of 'arguments', nor a system of knowledge seeking a 'rational' justification.   The experience of Nihilism, in its distinct yet relational forms of boredom, anxiety, depression, ecstasy, despair, and so on, for those who have felt Its presence, are taken as a 'reality'.  We must seek to discover whether there is some 'message' to be found within Nihilism and to draw out any 'constructive' content, even if, in the end, it is ultimately illusory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Even if the experience of the void were only a deception, it would still deserve to be tried.  What it proposes, what it attempts, is to reduce to nothing both life and death, and this with the sole intention of making them endurable to us.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The 'truth' of the suggested consequences of Nihilism will be left to subjectivity.  We will follow the sentiment of Heisman when he states that “Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;While we are specifically looking to explore whether there is any sort of 'constructive' content, any sort of 'message', to be found within Nihilism for which we may build a language, 'philosophy' as we have defined it, although without demanding any one authoritative interpretation or absolute vocabulary.  With regards to the experience of Nihilism, one may choose a reductionist, materialist explanation as easily as one may choose what we may refer to as Transcendental.  The former is found within the worldly philosophy/psychology and metaphysical naturalism of science and psychology, while the latter normally falls under the domain of religion or theology and the subsequent dying 'languages' developed within these disciplines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The Philosopher, Heidegger, and his analysis of the human condition will be paramount for exploring Nihilism as the universal human experience.  Heidegger makes definitive distinctions in his analysis of the human condition to ensure there is no added confusion by a placing of any particular, definite, structures onto or into his language.  This 'separating from' is put in terms of disallowing any general 'atheistic' or 'theistic' accounts.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“The ontological analysis of conscience on which we are thus embarking, is prior to any description and classification of Experiences of conscience, and likewise lies outside of any biological 'explanation' of this phenomenon (which would mean its dissolution).  But it is no less distant from a theological exegesis of conscience or any employment of this phenomenon for proofs of God or for establishing an 'immediate' consciousness of God...we must neither exaggerate its outcome nor make perverse claims about it and lessen its worth.”  Heidegger pg. 313</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“If the interpretation continues in this direction, one supplies a possessor for the power thus posited, or one takes the power itself as a person who makes himself known- namely God.  On the other hand one may try to reject this explanation in which the caller is taken as an alien manifestation of such a power, and to explain away the conscience 'biologically' at the same time. Both these explanations pass over the phenomenal findings too hastily.”  Heidegger pg. 320</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Only when death is conceived in its full ontological essence can we have any methodological assurance in even asking what may be after death; only then can we do so with meaning and justification. Whether such a question is a possible theoretical question at all will not be decided here.”  Heidegger pg. 292</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“This demands that we transform our human being into its openness (dread effects this transformation in us) so that we can grasp the nothing that shows up in dread exactly as it shows up. It also demands that we expressly avoid all characterizations of the nothing that do not come from a corresponding experience of the nothing. (my emphasis)”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;This suggests that the term 'religious' must be avoided, or re-defined, due to its necessary vagueness, and due to its inevitably of being dragged down into the world of pragmatism and self-concern that goes by the name of 'religious' today.  Furthermore, it must also reject a sort of 'lyricism' of that found within mystic traditions.  Rather, the more 'neutral' term 'Transcendence' will be substituted in its place.  'Transcendence' here need not be concerned with anything accept that which can be referred to as Wholly-Other.  In other words, as suggestive of a feature of human experience that is not entirely deconstructive or naturalistic.  It must also be made clear that Transcendence is not associated with the 'supernatural', in any 'spooky' sense, due to this term also containing many specifically mystical/mythical 'religious' connotations, e.g. heaven, hell, demons, angels, and so on, that need not concern us here.  The Nihilistic experience is one, we claim, that holds, or lends itself, to a Transcendent interpretation, yet is equally founded, with equal powers of convincing, within the dogmas of Naturalism.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“The void allows us to erode the idea of being; but it is not drawn into this erosion itself; it survives the an attack which would be self-destructive for any other idea.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“If the myth is understood literally, philosophy must reject it as absurd.  It must demythologize the sacred stories, transform the myth into a philosophy of religion and finally into a philosophy without religion.”  Tillich</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;We claim the various depths of Nihilism are the ground of all Transcendent interpretations of human experience.  This perennial experience is found in abundance, yet any particular 'path' or 'solution' proposed by any individual, when confronted with Nihilism, will be ignored and seen as a distraction from any 'message' that may be found within the 'reality' of Nihilism.  There is no escaping from Nihilism, there is no 'completion' within this world.  The finite is indefinitely separated from the Infinite.  All confusions, whether philosophical, naturalistic, or religious, stem from attempts of moving past the Nihilistic experience. It would therefore be prudent to heed Heidegger's words.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Behind all the dogmas, rituals, ceremonies, and assorted 'practical' modes of behavior normally found within most of the worlds religions, there is a common ground that is, for the most part, consciously or intuitively covered up (no one is completely free from experiencing Nihilism).  The 'practical' behaviors end up as another distraction from the universal nature of Nihilism.  The worldly forms of religion, when taken as ends in themselves, when taken literally, are indistinguishable from a wholly materialist, naturalistic worldview.  The finite language of human beings cannot ever be in complete grasp of the Other.  The misguided presumption of 'sacred', as is given the label to such 'religious' movements, must be recognized solely in their subjectivity; and even then within the acknowledgment of a complete skepticism.  The same criticism holds for philosophy and everyday life with its worldly pursuits.  Any 'meaning' that is built upon a material, transitory structure will inevitably collapse as illusory (regardless if it collapses for any one individual).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Any fool can talk. Even parrots talk. Talking is one thing, and realising is another. Philosophies, and doctrines, and arguments, and books, and theories, and churches, and sects, and all these things are good in their own way; but when that realisation comes, these things drop away.” Swami Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“In true faith the ultimate concern is a concern about the truly ultimate; while in idolatrous faith preliminary, finite realities are elevated to the rank of ultimacy.  The inescapable consequence of idolatrous faith is 'existential disappointment,' a disappointment which penetrates into the very existence of man!”  Tillich</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;For those who have not suffered the overwhelming experience of Nothingness, for those who still find 'something' within the world, these words will more than likely be tossed away and labeled as 'whining and pouting'.  To interpret a Taoist saying into the relevance of Nihilism: the common people will laugh at it, the 'intellectual' will understand but not experience, and the one who experiences will be left to the Nothingness of the world.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“the It world...one has to live and also can live comfortably- and that even offers us all sorts of stimulations and excitements, activities and knowledge. In this firm and wholesome chronicle the You-moments appear as queer lyric-dramatic episodes.”  Buber</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“But along with this tranquilization, which forces Dasein away from its death, the “they” at the same time puts itself in the right and makes itself respectable by tacitly regulating the way in which one has to comport oneself towards death. It is already a matter of public acceptance that ‘thinking about death’ is a cowardly fear, a sign of insecurity on the part of Dasein, and a sombre way of fleeing from the world. The “they” does not permit us the courage for anxiety in the face of death.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“This ‘movement’ of Dasein in its own Being, we call its “downward plunge”. Dasein plunges out of itself into itself, into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic everydayness. But this plunge remains hidden from Dasein by the way things have been publicly interpreted, so much so, indeed, that it gets interpreted as a way of ‘ascending’ and ‘living concretely’.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;If Nihilism is, as we claim, the ground for all Transcendent thinking, we must first put an emphasis on the direct experience of Nihilism.  Swami Vivekananda's words speak to this:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“In one form or another, we are all in it. It is a most difficult and intricate state of things to understand. It has been preached in every country, taught everywhere, but only believed in by a few, because until we get the experiences ourselves we cannot believe in it (my emphasis). What does it show? Something very terrible. For it is all futile. Time, the avenger of everything, comes, and nothing is left. He swallows up the saint and the sinner, the king and the peasant, the beautiful and the ugly; he leaves nothing. Everything is rushing towards that one goal, destruction. Our knowledge, our arts, our sciences, everything is rushing towards it. None can stem the tide, none can hold it back for a minute. We may try to forget it, in the same way that persons in a plague-stricken city try to create oblivion by drinking, dancing, and other vain attempts, and so becoming paralysed. So we are trying to forget, trying to create oblivion by all sorts of sense-pleasures.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Nietzsche, the so-called 'Nihilistic-Prophet', also stresses the need for the experience of Nihilism.  In his words: “...because nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals— because we must experience nihilism before we can find out what value these 'values' really had.”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;”It might seem frightful to any one who does not realize the nothingness and absurdity of an isolated personal life, and who believes that he will never die. But I know that my life, considered in relation to my individual happiness, is, taken by itself, a stupendous farce, and that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death.”  Tolstoy</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Suddenly every vain hope became worthless to me.”  St. Augustine</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Tønnessen supplies a vivid example of the primacy of experience:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Another question...is the question of whether such insights can be taught...The so-called 'engaged' discourse introduced in heart-philosophy admits of a third component which we may tentatively designate the degree of integration of knowledge.  An example will indicate what may be meant by the expressions “integrated” and “integration”...the Finns caught a Russian spy...He knew the outcome...When finally the death sentence is pronounced, he completely collapses.  What on earth happened?  He knew the outcome with absolute certainty.  We should want to say the spy knows about his immanent death now, in a new and terrifying way.  He has suddenly obtained an insight, a knowledge which penetrates him, goes through bones and marrow and violently shakes up the total personality structure into its deepest and darkest labyrinths.  Unfortunately, this “integration” of knowledge cannot be taught in any ordinary sense of teaching.”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;There is a hidden meaningless throughout all of the worlds activities that are drawn out from such an experience of Nihilism.  But before going too far, what do we mean when we speak of an 'experience of Nihilism'?  We must first lay out the ontological basis of this Nothingness, which can be done in various forms.  Only then will there be any possibility of conceiving the development of a language of Nihilism.  Due to my lack of creativity, I will quote, at length, Tønnessen's graphic depiction of such an experience:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“They have a feeling of integral selfhood, of personal identity, and of the permanency of things.  They believe in their own continuity – in being made of good, lasting stuff – and in meaning and order and justice in life and in the universe.  In the most fortunate cases, there is a good, healthy unconditional surrender and submission to the norms of nicety and normalcy of the average, square-headed, stuffed-shirted, sanctimonious, middle-class North-American church-goer and bridge player, with his pseudo-intelligent, quasi-progressive, simili-cultured, platitudinal small-talk.  Happy days! In this the best of all possible worlds. One doesn't notice until too late.  In short: All is well (since nobody notices the end of 'all that is well') until one night: the day's work is well done and all the ships' crapulant fools frantically engulf themselves in a deadly serious game of bridge (till it is time for the night-cap and the tranquillizer).  One of the 'dummies,' a champion brass polisher, suffering from an acute case of uncaused depression, goes to lie down for a while; he doesn't have a dime for the jukebox; the room is painfully satiated with embarrassing silence.  Instantly and unexpectedly he is struck by an execrative curse of inverted serendipity.  He suddenly, in unbearable agony, sees himself as an upholstered pile of bones and knuckles, with the softer parts slung up in a bad on the front side, and his whole like as a ludicrously brief interlude between embryo and corpse, two repulsive caricatures of himself.  As for this flying farce, this nauseatingly trivial burlesque in a whirling coffin, and its aimless, whimsical flight through the void: 'What is it all about?' The question permeates him with dread and anguish, with 'ontological despair' and 'existential frustration.'”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“In dread, as we say, "something is uncanny." What do we mean by "something" and "is"? We cannot say what the uncanny something is about. There is something like this about the "as a whole”: all things and we ourselves sink into indifference. (my emphasis)  Not in the sense of merely disappearing, but rather, in its very moving away, it turns to us. This moving away of be-ing as a whole that closes in on us in dread pressures us.  There's nothing to get a hold on.  All that remains and comes over us in the slipping away of be-ing is this "no-thing. "Dread reveals no-thing.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“In particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not encountered as something definite with which one can concern onself; the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these 'says' anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have any involvement.  The world in which I exist has sunk into insignificance (my emphasis); and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement.  Anxiety is anxious in the face of the nothing of the world (my emphasis); but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the absence of what is present-at-hand with-the-world. The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does not have any involvement whatsoever, but can show itself in an empty mercilessness.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;We may also express Nihilism in the form of a question: first, put into your mind the most meaningful 'thing' of your existence, whether this is family, a project, a cause, a nation, or even 'oneself'.  Now, can you imagine what you hold to be most meaningful, the thing that makes your existence come across as a real possibility, as being worthless, as utterly void of all meaning?  I have yet to meet a person with even a slight indication of what this question is referring to.  To answer in the affirmative is to have experienced a deconstructive-terror that runs through one's entire being.  There is a vanishing of any ground that one has placed under the feet of existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;William James puts it this way: “Conceive yourself, if possible, suddenly stripped of all the emotion with which your world now inspires you, and try to imagine it AS IT EXISTS, purely by itself, without your favorable or unfavorable, hopeful or apprehensive comment. It will be almost impossible for you to realize such a condition of negativity and deadness.”  And although Nihilism is found universally within the human condition, the experience is still only to be received in piecemeal, which informs us on one possible reason for why its extreme forms are so rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“In great despair, for example, when all weight tends to dwindle away from things and the sense of things grows dark, the question looms.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; “If existence only relates itself to being by being aimed in advance at no-thing in order to be able to exist, and if no-thing originally becomes manifest only in dread, must we not then remain permanently suspended in this dread in order to be able to exist at all? Yet have we ourselves not already admitted that this original dread is rare? But above all, all of us exist and relate ourselves to being which we ourselves are not and which we ourselves are—without such dread. Is this not an arbitrary finding and the no-thing attributed to it an exaggeration?”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Now what does it mean that this original dread happens only in rare instances?  Nothing other than this: no-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in its originality. But how? By our getting lost in being in certain ways. The more we turn to being in our dealings, the less we let being as such slip away, the more we turn away from no-thing. Thus all the more certainly are we forced into the public superficialities of existence.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;'but why is the experience of agony so rare? Can it be that our hypothesis is entirely false and that sketching a metaphysics of death is possible only by accepting death's transcendental nature?”  Cioran&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“No one is continually subject to the obsession with this horror. Sometimes we turn from it, almost forget it...”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Now, the great majority of mankind endure life without any great protest, and believe, to this extent, in the value of existence, but that is because each individual decides and determines alone, and never comes out of his own personality like these exceptions: everything outside of the personal has no existence for them or at the utmost is observed as but a faint shadow.”  Nietzsche</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.  But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.”  Matthew 7:13-14</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Even the one who experiences Nihilism in a deeper form is left with a sense of suspicion, a suspicion that this 'Nihilism' is still too foreign.  All must ask a question concerning the actual 'reality' of Nihilism along with the intuition of 'a something' that lurks behind all Nihilistic experiences.  The busyness of the world, the conscious fleeing from the human condition, the 'taking serious' of any particular worldly endeavor, the lack of uncanniness within the material world, these are ways in which one drives out, consciously or instinctually, and misses Nihilism or any 'message' within that it may convey.  The path may be narrow, but why does it seem to also be 'obstructed' to such an extreme degree?  The 'falling' nature of human beings as being wrapped up within the world, combined with the rarity of Nihilism, is an unbearable weight for the one who is seeking authenticity, for one attempting a participation with Nihilism.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(maybe Kierkegaard “double-mindedness” and James “divided-self” quotes here?)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“When anxiety has subsided, then in our everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say that ‘it was really nothing’.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Compared to philosophers, saints know nothing.  Yet they know everything. Compared to Aristotle, any saint is illiterate.  What makes us then believe that we might learn more from the latter?  Because all of the philosophers put together are not worth a single saint.  Philosophy has no answers.  Compared to philosophy, saintliness is an exact science.  It gives us precise answers to questions that philosophers do not even dare consider. Its method is suffering and its goal is God.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;One way in which Nietzsche speaks of Nihilism comes from a term he referred to as the 'Absurd Valuation'.  He puts his description in the mouth of his Zarathustra:  “What is your greatest experience? It is the hour of the great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness becomes repulsive to you, and even your reason and virtue.  The hour when you say: "What good is my happiness! It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment. But my happiness should justify existence itself!  The hour when you say: "What good is my reason! does it long for knowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!"  The hour when you say: "What good are my virtues?! As yet they have not made me rage with passion. How weary I am of my good and evil! It is all poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;I prefer the term 'Absurd Perspective'.  This is the 'revelation' of the paralyzing nature of Nihilism that comes from the absence of values, hence making all judgments, movements, efforts, concerns, and offenses as baseless as any other; we are left with any response or action being reduced to Absurdity, since humans are necessarily forced to make value judgments in a valueless universe.  All human movements are motivated by a value judgment.  Without moral values, no non-arbitrary human action can be made.  With all possibilities 'equivalent' there is no right or wrong, there is no up or down, all possibilities drop off, there is only Nothing...yet humans act in the world.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;An aspect of the Absurd Perspective can in fact be described in an empirical context found within the consequences of the 'multi-verse' or 'world-assemble', a view that many modern physicists postulate as a description of 'reality'.  Regardless if the multi-verse is the 'correct' view of reality, assuming it is 'true', there are consequences that follow from such a position, which go seemingly unnoticed by both scientists and philosophers of science.  In short, if there are an infinite number of 'universes' and, in theory, an infinite number of 'yous', then any decision, in any given situation that is possible, will be made by one of 'you'.  Therefore, it is only an illusion when one finds themselves 'caught' in some form of a 'moral crisis', since no matter which option is chosen, whether you believe it to be the 'right' decision based on intuition, feelings, or from philosophical comtemplation, all other options will also be chosen, by 'you'.  This turns every 'important' choice or decision into a triviality.  Subjective morality and meaning are utterly empty, when choice is simply illusory.  This is to refrain from getting stuck in the cobwebs of 'free will' and 'determinism'.  If an infinite world-assemble is in fact our reality,  then determinism is as true as it ever could be, even if 'free will', if this concept can even be made sense of, is granted in each individual universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The reply is anticipated: 'Regardless if all choices are made elsewhere, my decision still matters here, to me, in this world?”  Let's also not digress into details concerning the 'A' and 'B' theories of time.  But, we may suggest, in passing, that if we assume that the 'B' theory of time is correct, and there is no temporal becoming, there is no privileged 'now'.  Therefore, your birth is as 'real' as your death; your existence is equivalent to a movie reel that is sprawled out across the ground frame by frame.  Even with that said, hapless as it is, there is no doubt that this still does matter to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;We can put forth Nihilism in yet another way.  The insatiable credulity in the way in which most humans force an elevation of subjective meaning on to one's life, with a conscious denial of objectivity, shows a lack of The Experience concerning the paradoxical nature of human subjectivity and 'deep-time'.  Human minds have not 'evolved' in a way in which to properly handle the exorbitant amount of time in which science has so far discovered about the universe and the human situation within it.  Within the billions of years of evolution, the almost fourteen billion year old observable piece of space-time, humans have developed a local, restricted, 'small world' understanding of the situation they find themselves in.  This 'small world' understanding allows for most to live safely, 'out of sight-out of mind', shielded from the horrors that underpin self-conscious existence.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The 'problem' of the denial of Nihilism, followed by the proposing of a meaning within the world of 'deep time', comes from the fact that most of human existence has been completely erased without a trace of their even 'being here', except if one wants to count what can be found of 'them' in the strands of our DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“All civilizations become defunct. All species die out. There is even an expiration date on the universe itself...the universe as nothing in motion.”  Ligotti</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“A thousand varieties of man -- Piltdown, Neanderthal, Chellean, Acheulean, Mousterian, Aurignacian, Cro-magnon, Rhodesian, Pekin man -- lived for thousands of years, fought, thought, invented, painted, carved, made children, and left no more to posterity than a few flints and scratches, forgotten for millennia and found only by the picks and spades of our inquisitive day. &nbsp; A thousand civilizations have disappeared under the ocean or the earth, leaving, like Atlantis, merely a legend behind...”  Durant</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“All the power of knowledge and wealth once made has passed away — all the sciences of the ancients, lost, lost forever. Nobody knows how. That teaches us a grand lesson. Vanity of vanities; all is vanity and vexation of the spirit.”   Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“...everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning: this is now the "meaning" of life...Why be public-spirited? Why take any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour together, trust one another, or concern one's self about the common welfare, and try to serve it?”  Nietzsche&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;To pronounce everything as 'meaningless' is to show zero appreciation for every human struggle, the billions of years of conflict found within all sentient creatures, down to every replicating cell;  what a big responsibility to take on, if there was any such thing as 'responsibility'.  Is the most hubris filled act that of embracing of Nihilism?  Is the Saint, the one who renounces the entire world, nothing but the most selfish of creatures?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;All actions will be erased.  All accomplishments will disappear.  All cares, concerns, achievements, disappointments, and failures will be as if they never occurred.  With this fact of existence, why is it that humans still insist on thrusting a sense of worldly meaning onto their individual lives?  Why can someone sit there with a smile on their face, proclaim 'But my life is meaningful!', in the face of the consequences of 'deep time', and not be seen as psychologically or intellectually deficient?  The only way to justify such thought and behavior, in a universe that itself will eventually die in ruins, is to maintain some neurotic form of justification for the value of being alive.  How does one justify their stance of intrinsic value on life, no matter what (for now stepping back from the proponents of euthanasia or the proclamations of many 'theistic' believers)?  The 'logic' of life, that existence is 'better' than non-existence, has not only proceeded without justification, it is rarely even questioned.  Worldly 'meaning' is dead. Yet there is no 'argument' to convince another against being able to find meaning within the world.  One must experience the Nothing of the world directly.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“...there are two inevitable conditions of life, confronting all of us, which destroy its whole meaning; (1) death, which may at any moment pounce upon each of us; and (2) the transitoriness of all our works, which so soon pass away and leave no trace...And therefore, however we may conceal it from ourselves, we cannot help seeing that the significance of our life cannot lie in our personal fleshly existence...”  Tolstoy</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;An illustration may bring some additional clarity, even if it does lack any force of convincing.  Imagine you wake up one day and find yourself inside of a gated tennis court.  You are there with another person, racket in hand, and the gate to the court cannot be opened, there is no escape.  Your partner happens to mention that there is no tennis ball, yet insists on 'playing'.  Would you consent to this game of 'tennis'?  Would you 'go through the motions' of swinging mindlessly at a phantom ball that does not exist?  Would you argue with your partner who takes a swing at the 'ball' and asserts on his scoring a point?  Would you regard the 'meaning' that your partner finds in this game worthy of the label 'meaningful'?  If you could invent some form of subjective meaning to this 'game', how long would it keep you content?  And can you change your mind, many times over, on the 'meaning' of this game?  How long would you stay motivated to participate?  At what point would you give up?  Would anyone want, or be able, to participate in such an obscene activity?   Can anyone, who's not simply being argumentative or denialistic, claim any 'meaning' behind such an activity?  Anyone perceiving the situation properly would have to insist on not participating in such a ridiculous situation.  But, then, what?</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Genuine boredom has not yet arrived if we are merely bored with this book or that movie, with this job or that idle moment. Genuine boredom occurs when one’s whole world is boring. Then abysmal boredom, like a muffling fog, drifts where it will in the depths of our openness, sucking everything and everyone, and ourselves along with them, into a numbing sameness. This kind of boredom reveals what-is in terms of a whole.”  Heidegger</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Nihilism takes the 'ball' away from the game of life.  Each new 'game' that is invented eventually succumbs to absurdity and boredom.  One constantly finds new things 'to do', yet are they ever fully satisfied?  To wonder as Pascal did: why can't humans sit alone in a room?  I'll let Pascal expand on this observation:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;This fact, that man is always attempting to do something, shows that there is some search he is on.  Is this purely a natural instinct to survive and reproduce?  A 'will to live' for no Ultimate reason?  This Transcendental yearning, this pull towards the Infinite, instead of being confronted, is almost always translated into some worldly activity.  There is nothing to find in this world.  People want Simple Salvation; no one wants to participate in the Nothingness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Hiding facts is not the way to find a remedy. As you all know, a hare hunted by dogs puts its head down and thinks itself safe; so, when we run into optimism; we do just like the hare, but that is no remedy.”  Vivekananda</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Everything that we do to make our existence secure is like the act of the ostrich, when she hides her head in the sand, and does not see that her destruction is near. But we are even more foolish than the ostrich.”  Tolstoy</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;I see a world of human bodies, scampering around in ignorant-confusion, within the illusion of confidence, all with their own little, black cloud of death hovering over their heads.  “What a Meaningful life!”, shouted the man who's heart only seconds later unknowingly delivered him into Nothingness.  He's already a memory.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Tolstoy captures his realization of Nihilism as follows:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“I was only astonished that this had not occurred to me before, from premises which had so long been known. Illness and death would come (indeed they had come), if not to-day, then to-morrow, to those whom I loved, to myself, and nothing would remain but stench and worms. All my acts, whatever I did, would sooner or later be forgotten, and I myself be nowhere. Why, then, busy one's self with anything? How could men see this and live? It is possible to live only as long as life intoxicates us; as soon as we are sober again we see that it is all a delusion, and a stupid one! In this, indeed, there is nothing either ludicrous or amusing; it is only cruel and absurd.”  (pg. 282 journal, Buddha, Pascal, Vivekananda)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;If the world is Nothing, and is experienced as such, what is left?  Madness, suicide, or the Other.  The 'message' of Nihilism may not be wholly deconstructive, yet, at the same time, is the 'More' of Nihilism essentially unknowable?  What is the 'More' of Nihilism?  Are 'madness, suicide, and the Other' all that distinct?  Does madness lead to suicide, or to the Other?  Does the Other lead to Suicide?  To develop a language or philosophy of Nihilism leaves open the possibility that it may indeed lead to, or find no distinction in, madness, suicide or the Other.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“And indeed the Christian is, in a certain sense--in an ultimate sense--a "Nihilist"; for to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all. This is, of course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined here, where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism that proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian's is a "Nihilism" that proceeds from abundance.”  Fr.  Sarephim Rose&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“in such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death. and you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“But then, Nothingness is only Nothingness. How did it happen to turn into Something? And once having become Something, how did it acquire such limitless power over man, and even over all existence?”  Shestov<hr></div><div><h1><br></h1><h1>Extra notes and things</h1><br></div><div>Figure out where the two quotes directly below fit in-&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Anyone who gives himself up to writing believes- without realizing the fact- that his work will survive the years, the ages, time itself...If he felt, while he was at work on it, that it was perishable, he would leave of where he was, he could never finish.  Activity and credulity are correlative terms.”  Cioran</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Retire, reader, into yourself and imagine a slow dissolution of yourself—the light dimming about you—all things becoming dumb and soundless, enveloping you in silence—the objects that you handle crumbling away between your hands—the ground slipping from under your feet—your very memory vanishing as if in a swoon —everything melting away from you into nothingness and you yourself also melting away—the very consciousness of nothingness, merely as the phantom harbourage of a shadow, not even remaining to you. I have heard it related of a poor harvester who died in a hospital bed, that when the priest went to anoint his hands with the oil of extreme unction, he refused to open his right hand, which clutched a few dirty coins, not considering that very soon neither his hand nor he him self would be his own any more. And so we close and clench, not our hand, but our heart, seeking to clutch the world in it. A friend confessed to me that, foreseeing while in the full vigour of physical health the near approach of a violent death, he proposed to concentrate his life and spend the few days which he calculated still remained to him in writing a book. Vanity of vanities!”  Unamuno</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“Not for nothing did he give the name The Concept of Dread to one of the most remarkable of his works. He had discovered in himself and others a fear that was unaccountable, unjustifiable, and unreasonable, and moreover, as we shall presently see, a fear of Nothingness. And to anticipate what will be explained later, it must here be said that in his struggle with his fear of Nothingness, he remained as before in the power of Nothingness. I must add that the fear of Nothingness, in the sense given it by Kierkegaard, is not a personal, subjective trait of his. Owing to the special conditions of his existence, he merely exposed this fear and the Nothingness that gives rise to it with a precision distinguished by its clarity and its great vividness. Or perhaps we might put it this way: that which exists only potentially, and therefore invisibly, in the souls of other men became for him an actuality, an everyday reality. This is why he maintained that the beginning of philosophy is not wonder but despair. As long as a man wonders, he has not yet touched on the mysteries of being. Only despair brings him to the brink, to the limits of the existing. And if philosophy, as we have always been told, seeks the beginnings, sources, and roots of everything, then whether it wishes to or not it must pass through despair.”  Shestov</div><div><br></div><div>“...God only is wise; and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth little or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name by way of illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest, who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing.”  Plato</div><div><br></div><div>“This "anxiety" and this "abyss" are precisely the nothingness out of which God has called each man into being”  Seraphim Rose</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;“What misery to live in this world! We are like men whose enemies are at the door, who must not lay aside their arms, even while sleeping or eating, and are always in dread lest the foe should enter the fortress by some breach in the walls.  How canst Thou wish us to prize such a wretched existence?”  St. Theresa of Avila</div><div><br></div><div>“St Augustine says. "the strong attraction of the soul to the Divine reduces everything to nothingness.”  Eckhart</div><div><br></div><div>“But then, Nothingness is only Nothingness. How did it happen to turn into Something? And once having become Something, how did it acquire such limitless power over man, and even over all existence?”  Shestov (I like this quote because denotes the power of the experience. However, it seemingly flies in the face of our prior observations of the rarity of the experience)</div><div><br></div><div>“in such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death. and you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness.”  Cioran (On the Heights of Despair, Cioran speaks of “Nothingness as a revelation”, and describes the experience of subjectivity “falling” out from underneath onself.  Get more of his quotes in this section, if I haven’t already put them in “Naturalism”.</div><div><br></div><div>“When the centre of gravity of life is placed, not in life itself, but in "the beyond"--in nothingness--then one has taken away its centre of gravity altogether. The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all reason, all natural instinct--henceforth, everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning: this is now the "meaning" of life. . .. Why be public-spirited? Why take any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour together, trust one another, or concern one's self about the common welfare, and try to serve it?”  Nietzsche  (I know Nietzsche is arguing against this, as he sees Christianity the cause for this, but it is still a good description of Nihilism; maybe use it somewhere)</div><div><br></div><div>Where James’/‘imagining meaningful as meaningless’ quote is, speak on the ‘spectrum’ of the experience of Nihilism.  Uncanny, where there is a sense of ‘unease’, yet it leaves as quickly as it came to you.  You can usually think to oneself: “No, that isn’t right.  That’s a ridiculous idea..” and then proceed to nervously chuckle it off, as if it was a strange instance of ‘deja vu’, and continute upon with your existing.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=Nihiltheism" data-non-editable="true" spellcheck="false" data-upnote-tag="#Nihiltheism" title="#Nihiltheism">#Nihiltheism</a>&nbsp;<a href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=direxperience" data-non-editable="true" spellcheck="false" data-upnote-tag="#direxperience" title="#direxperience">#direxperience</a><br></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb">The Religious Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f">-Nihilism Preface-</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5">The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384">The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9">Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3">The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0">The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing</a></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div></div></div></body>

   9: <h2><em>The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism</em>&nbsp;</h2><h3>-Philosophy and Direct Experience-</h3><br>“...the
  10: most important question is whether there is an important question.
  11: The only serious question is whether there is anything to take
  12: seriously.” Heisman<br>
  13: <br>
  14: 	“To study philosophy is nothing
  15: but to prepare one's self to die."  Cicero<br>
  16: <br>
  17: 	“Only
  18: because no-thing is manifest at the heart of existence can the full
  19: strangeness of being come over us. Only if the strangeness of being
  20: impresses us does it waken us and open us up to wonder. Only on the
  21: basis of wonder, that is, the manifestness of no-thing, does the
  22: "Why?" come up.”  Heidegger<br>
  23: <br>
  24: 	The Nothing of
  25: the world must be seen through the filthiest of lenses.  The
  26: meaninglessness of human activity is found, not within a subjective
  27: value judgment, but rather in the ignorant finitude of all human
  28: activity.  The 'pushing forward' of most human mindsets is one that
  29: is built upon the ignorance of the experience of Nihilism. 
  30: Distractions and diversions are written into the language of 'normal'
  31: human beings.  What does one do when these distractions and
  32: diversions fail, when the natural mechanisms of consciousness that
  33: keep a human 'sane' break down? What does one do when one comes 'face
  34: to face' with Nihilism?  Is suicide a 'rational' option in the face
  35: of Nothingness?  Is there a 'path' that allows one to live alongside
  36: the Nothing?  Is the 'naked anxiety' found within human experience
  37: too much of a burden for one to endure, never mind pursue, in the
  38: constructing of a world-view?  Can one build a philosophy of religion
  39: based upon the Nothing of the world?  Beyond the question of
  40: 'possibility' with regards to constructing such a philosophy of
  41: religion, is there some demand to do so?  Does the Nihilistic
  42: experience contain any 'constructive' content that may allow itself
  43: to be interpreted as a 'religious' experience? <br>
  44: <br>
  45: 	“All
  46: great conversions are born from the sudden revelation of life's
  47: meaninglessness.  Nothing could be more impressive than this sudden
  48: apprehension of the void of existence.”  Cioran<br>
  49: 	<br>
  50: 	Humans
  51: are damned to philosophize, whether this is done in the unlearned
  52: fashion of the everyday person who is fooled into thinking he is
  53: 'free', 'smart', and 'comfortable' while in the chains of his
  54: cliches, or whether done in the style of the lofty analytic
  55: philosopher who believes that he is 'making a difference' when he
  56: puts on his suit and tie, stands up in front of a room of seven, and
  57: delivers his paper on 'counter-factuals'.   As it is practiced in the
  58: American Universities, philosophy has become seemingly nothing more
  59: than a fancy Sudoku puzzle used to satiate the boredom of
  60: 'intellectuals'.  The claims of Nihilism (taken in their overlapping
  61: declarations concerning the 'negative' status of moral, existential,
  62: epistemological, and metaphysical 'truths') have been dispelled, at
  63: best, as 'unanswerable', and at worst, as 'unworthy' for concern,
  64: within most of the analytical tradition.  Ultimate questions have
  65: been diminished into a clash of one incomplete argument against
  66: another.<br>
  67: <br>
  68: 	“When he has not a book between his fingers he
  69: cannot think. When he thinks, he responds to a stimulus (a thought he
  70: has read),-finally all he does is to react. The scholar exhausts his
  71: whole strength in saying either " yes " or " no "
  72: to matter which has already been thought out, or in criticising it-he
  73: is no longer capable of thought on his own account. ... In him the
  74: instinct of self-defence has decayed, otherwise he would defend
  75: himself against books. The scholar is a decadent.” 
  76: Nietzsche<br>
  77: <br>
  78: 	Listen to a scholar speak; within the first few
  79: words, at best sentences, the name of another thinker will come out
  80: of their mouth.  They will then begin to sketch this thinker’s
  81: ideas or concepts.  They will then input some small amount of their
  82: own thoughts, that rarely constitute much more than a smearing around
  83: of the other thinker’s thoughts.  <br>
  84: <br>
  85:  	The atheist
  86: philosopher's with their so-called 'problem of evil' act as if their
  87: rejection of a ‘god’, one that can be boxed into the finite human
  88: intellect, is somehow the 'intellectually superior' position while
  89: conveniently forgetting the fact that they themselves lack any
  90: non-pragmatic ground for trusting human reason within a wholly
  91: naturalistic worldview.  Why believe that your inductive inferences
  92: about 'God's existence' ought to be grounded purely in reason?  In
  93: other words, why be 'rational'?  Why value reason over Absurdity in
  94: an Ultimately purposeless universe that has no 'end' or goal? <br>
  95: 	<br>
  96: 	“We
  97: are all atheists, and yet we try to fight the man who admits it. We
  98: are all in the dark; religion is to us a mere intellectual assent, a
  99: mere talk, a mere nothing. We often consider a man religious who can
 100: talk well. But this is not religion.”  Vivekananda	<br>
 101: <br>
 102: 	It
 103: is no better on the other side, where one finds 'religious'
 104: philosophers shelling out their hubris filled 'theodicies' in a
 105: pathetic effort to defend their small god by diminishing the Other
 106: into some conception of human 'oughts' or a self-satisfying version
 107: of skepticism that never goes far enough to stop all their babble
 108: about the Other. The scene is as pathetic, if so much so as to be
 109: comical, as to be equivalent to a sleep-walker, with a scalpel in his
 110: hand, strutting with confidence into the operating room 'ready' to
 111: perform surgery.  Philosophy does all this while working under the
 112: guise of a Socratic Method, yet without a mindset that even remotely
 113: resembles that of a Doubting Socrates. <br>
 114: <br>
 115: 	“Philosophy can
 116: never directly supply the forces and create the mechanisms and
 117: opportunities that bring about a historical state of affairs, if only
 118: because philosophy is always the direct concern of the few. Which
 119: few? The ones who transform creatively, who unsettle things.” 
 120: Heidegger<br>
 121: <br>
 122: 	“Only the small begins small—the small,
 123: whole dubious greatness consists in diminishing everything...” 
 124: Heidegger<br>
 125: <br>
 126: 	“To look upon healthier concepts and values
 127: from the standpoint of the sick, and conversely to look down upon the
 128: secret work of the instincts of decadence from the standpoint of him
 129: who is laden and self-reliant with the richness of life-this has been
 130: my longest exercise, my principal experience. If in anything at all,
 131: it was in this that I became a master.”  Nietzsche (The entire
 132: point of philosophy.  A position and its counter)<br>
 133: <br>
 134: 	“First,
 135: I attack only things that are triumphant-if necessary I wait until
 136: they become triumphant. Secondly, I attack only those things against
 137: which I find no allies, against which I stand alone-against which I
 138: compromise nobody but myself...I have not yet taken one single step
 139: before the public eye, which did not compromise me: that is my
 140: criterion of a proper mode of action.”  Nietzsche <br>
 141: <br>
 142: 	“Understanding
 143: has revealed to us that there is nowhere to flee from Nothingness.”
 144: Shestov<br>
 145: 	<br>
 146: 	Philosophy is hanging itself.<br>
 147: <br>
 148: 	This
 149: paradigm in philosophy, of the 'supremacy' of reason, is based upon a
 150: false interpretation of the Socratic Method that has been deformed by
 151: the positivistic, scientism style of thinking that philosopher's,
 152: disregarding Heidegger's warnings, attempt to 'follow' along
 153: distorting philosophy into a false counterpart of science. 
 154: Philosophers have ambitiously 'elevated' reason, as the sole
 155: characteristic of human beings that separates us from other animals,
 156: to an exaggerated degree.  Is the 'Socratic Method' to be used as a
 157: tool for knowledge or is it a way to open up the mystery of human
 158: existence?  Is this bizarre method of analytic philosophy the
 159: explanation for why philosophers are constantly talking past one
 160: another, cloaking philosophy into a 'rationalization' for beliefs
 161: that are held on other grounds besides 'reason'?  Whatever
 162: 'philosophy' actually is, if pursued honestly and fully, does it not
 163: lead to skepticism and doubt?  Does it not leave one with the
 164: question 'Why?'  Is philosophy's false 'elevation' of reason the
 165: drive behind the criticisms coming from the scientistic community? 
 166: The analytic tradition of philosophy is too distant from the
 167: existential conditions of man.  The 'intellectual' trappings on the
 168: philosophers have eliminated the direct experiences of certain forms
 169: of human consciousness, in turn giving these 'thinkers' the false
 170: impression that they are 'doing something' with their existence. 
 171: <br>
 172: <br>
 173: 	“yet other philosophies and doctrines say almost
 174: nothing about death.  the only valid attitude is absolute silence or
 175: a cry of despair.  some people maintain that the fear of death does
 176: not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i
 177: there is no death, and once dead there is no i any longer. these
 178: people have forgotten about the very strange phenomenon of gradual
 179: agony. what comfort does this artificial distinction between the i
 180: and death offer a man who has a strong premonition of death?  what
 181: meaning can logical argument or subtle thought have for someone
 182: deeply imbued with a feeling of the irrevocable? all attempts to
 183: bring existential questions onto a logical plane are null and void. 
 184: philosophers are too proud to confess their fear of death and too
 185: supercilious to acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness. their
 186: reflections on death exhibit a hypocritical serenity; in fact, they
 187: tremble with fear more than anyone else. one should not forget that
 188: philosophy is the art of masking inner torments.” 
 189: Cioran<br>
 190: <br>
 191: 	'Intellectual' notions of Nihilism are always
 192: stillborn.  No one knows</div>
 193: <div>
 194: what is going on here.  No one knows the 'Why?' to existence.  Why is
 195: it, then, that philosophers move forward with an attitude of
 196: self-assurance, in a purely pragmatic or worldly fashion, without any
 197: ground beneath them?  Why do they build these philosophical systems
 198: in the air?  Does the equivalent of a 'One has to live' tag-line
 199: suffice, amongst all the convoluted jargon, for today's philosophers?
 200:  Why not simply blow your brains out the back of your head?  Are the
 201: fleeting 'joys' and transitory 'attachments' of your life worth
 202: keeping you within the nightmare of human existence?<br>
 203: <br>
 204: 	“And
 205: the most tragic problem of philosophy is to reconcile intellectual
 206: necessities with the necessities of the heart and the will. For it is
 207: on this rock that every philosophy that pretends to resolve the
 208: eternal and tragic contradiction, the basis of our existence, breaks
 209: to pieces. But do all men face this contradiction squarely?” 
 210: Unamuno<br>
 211: <br>
 212: 	“only the organic and existential thinker is
 213: capable of this kind of seriousness, because truth for him is alive,
 214: born from inner agony and organic disorder rather than useless
 215: speculation. out of the shadow of the abstract man, who thinks for
 216: the pleasure of thinking, emerges the organic man, who thinks because
 217: of a vital imbalance, and who is beyond science and art.” 
 218: Cioran<br>
 219: <br>
 220: 	“Some people, it is true, can live contentedly
 221: with a philosophy of meaninglessness for a very long time.  But in
 222: most cases it will be found that these people possess some talent or
 223: accomplishment that permits them to live a life which, to a limited
 224: extent, is profoundly meaningful and valuable.  Thus an artist, or a
 225: man of science can profess a philosophy of general meaninglessness
 226: and yet lead a perfectly contented life...artistic creation and
 227: scientific research are absorbingly delightful occupations...They are
 228: proclaimed to be ends absolutely in themselves – ends so admirable
 229: that those who pursue them are excused from bothering about anything
 230: else.”  Huxley<br>
 231: <br>
 232: 	Schopenhauer wrote that “Philosophy
 233: can never do more than interpret and explain what is given.” 
 234: Philosophy is the unending 'Why?” in an attempt to open up the
 235: mystery of being, to reach out towards the ground of all things. 
 236: Philosophy lacks any authoritative, normative prescriptions in and of
 237: itself; philosophy is only concerned with the 'logical' consequences
 238: of a particular proposition, regardless of the ontology of any
 239: specific consequences or their starting point.  Philosophy, then, if
 240: it is to contribute anything to our project, must derive an analysis,
 241: or a 'map of consequences', that are drawn out and put into a new
 242: language that is grounded in the direct human experience of Nihilism.
 243:  This is the preambles of such a task. (Maybe this needs to be the
 244: opening paragraph)<br>
 245: <br>
 246: 	“The mind is not to be ruffled by
 247: vain arguments, because argument will not help us to know God. It is
 248: a question of fact, and not of argument. All argument and reasoning
 249: must be based upon certain perceptions. Without these, there cannot
 250: be any argument. Reasoning is the method of comparison between
 251: certain facts which we have already perceived.”  Vivekananda<br>
 252: <br>
 253: 	Does
 254: philosophy, as defined, therefore, have any contribution to make
 255: concerning the experience of Nihilism?  Our 'philosophy' is not a
 256: series of 'arguments', nor a system of knowledge seeking a 'rational'
 257: justification.   The experience of Nihilism, in its distinct yet
 258: relational forms of boredom, anxiety, depression, ecstasy, despair,
 259: and so on, for those who have felt Its presence, are taken as a
 260: 'reality'.  We must seek to discover whether there is some 'message'
 261: to be found within Nihilism and to draw out any 'constructive'
 262: content, even if, in the end, it is ultimately illusory.  <br>
 263: <br>
 264: 	“Even
 265: if the experience of the void were only a deception, it would still
 266: deserve to be tried.  What it proposes, what it attempts, is to
 267: reduce to nothing both life and death, and this with the sole
 268: intention of making them endurable to us.”  Cioran<br>
 269: <br>
 270: 	The
 271: 'truth' of the suggested consequences of Nihilism will be left to
 272: subjectivity.  We will follow the sentiment of Heisman when he states
 273: that “Nihilism is where science and philosophy meet.”    <br>
 274: 	While
 275: we are specifically looking to explore whether there is any sort of
 276: 'constructive' content, any sort of 'message', to be found within
 277: Nihilism for which we may build a language, 'philosophy' as we have
 278: defined it, although without demanding any one authoritative
 279: interpretation or absolute vocabulary.  With regards to the
 280: experience of Nihilism, one may choose a reductionist, materialist
 281: explanation as easily as one may choose what we may refer to as
 282: Transcendental.  The former is found within the worldly
 283: philosophy/psychology and metaphysical naturalism of science and
 284: psychology, while the latter normally falls under the domain of
 285: religion or theology and the subsequent dying 'languages' developed
 286: within these disciplines.  <br>
 287: 	The Philosopher, Heidegger, and his
 288: analysis of the human condition will be paramount for exploring
 289: Nihilism as the universal human experience.  Heidegger makes
 290: definitive distinctions in his analysis of the human condition to
 291: ensure there is no added confusion by a placing of any particular,
 292: definite, structures onto or into his language.  This 'separating
 293: from' is put in terms of disallowing any general 'atheistic' or
 294: 'theistic' accounts.<br>
 295: <br>
 296: 	“The ontological analysis of
 297: conscience on which we are thus embarking, is prior to any
 298: description and classification of Experiences of conscience, and
 299: likewise lies outside of any biological 'explanation' of this
 300: phenomenon (which would mean its dissolution).  But it is no less
 301: distant from a theological exegesis of conscience or any employment
 302: of this phenomenon for proofs of God or for establishing an
 303: 'immediate' consciousness of God...we must neither exaggerate its
 304: outcome nor make perverse claims about it and lessen its worth.” 
 305: Heidegger pg. 313<br>
 306: <br>
 307: 	“If the interpretation continues in
 308: this direction, one supplies a possessor for the power thus posited,
 309: or one takes the power itself as a person who makes himself known-
 310: namely God.  On the other hand one may try to reject this explanation
 311: in which the caller is taken as an alien manifestation of such a
 312: power, and to explain away the conscience 'biologically' at the same
 313: time. Both these explanations pass over the phenomenal findings too
 314: hastily.”  Heidegger pg. 320<br>
 315: <br>
 316: 	“Only when death is
 317: conceived in its full ontological essence can we have any
 318: methodological assurance in even asking what may be after death; only
 319: then can we do so with meaning and justification. Whether such a
 320: question is a possible theoretical question at all will not be
 321: decided here.”  Heidegger pg. 292<br>
 322: <br>
 323: 	“This demands that
 324: we transform our human being into its openness (dread effects this
 325: transformation in us) so that we can grasp the nothing that shows up
 326: in dread exactly as it shows up. It also demands that we expressly
 327: avoid all characterizations of the nothing that do not come from a
 328: corresponding experience of the nothing. (my emphasis)” 
 329: Heidegger<br>
 330: <br>
 331: 	This suggests that the term 'religious' must be
 332: avoided, or re-defined, due to its necessary vagueness, and due to
 333: its inevitably of being dragged down into the world of pragmatism and
 334: self-concern that goes by the name of 'religious' today. 
 335: Furthermore, it must also reject a sort of 'lyricism' of that found
 336: within mystic traditions.  Rather, the more 'neutral' term
 337: 'Transcendence' will be substituted in its place.  'Transcendence'
 338: here need not be concerned with anything accept that which can be
 339: referred to as Wholly-Other.  In other words, as suggestive of a
 340: feature of human experience that is not entirely deconstructive or
 341: naturalistic.  It must also be made clear that Transcendence is not
 342: associated with the 'supernatural', in any 'spooky' sense, due to
 343: this term also containing many specifically mystical/mythical
 344: 'religious' connotations, e.g. heaven, hell, demons, angels, and so
 345: on, that need not concern us here.  The Nihilistic experience is one,
 346: we claim, that holds, or lends itself, to a Transcendent
 347: interpretation, yet is equally founded, with equal powers of
 348: convincing, within the dogmas of Naturalism.<br>
 349: <br>
 350: 	“The void
 351: allows us to erode the idea of being; but it is not drawn into this
 352: erosion itself; it survives the an attack which would be
 353: self-destructive for any other idea.”  Cioran<br>
 354: <br>
 355: 	“If the
 356: myth is understood literally, philosophy must reject it as absurd. 
 357: It must demythologize the sacred stories, transform the myth into a
 358: philosophy of religion and finally into a philosophy without
 359: religion.”  Tillich<br>
 360: 	<br>
 361: 	We claim the various depths of
 362: Nihilism are the ground of all Transcendent interpretations of human
 363: experience.  This perennial experience is found in abundance, yet any
 364: particular 'path' or 'solution' proposed by any individual, when
 365: confronted with Nihilism, will be ignored and seen as a distraction
 366: from any 'message' that may be found within the 'reality' of
 367: Nihilism.  There is no escaping from Nihilism, there is no
 368: 'completion' within this world.  The finite is indefinitely separated
 369: from the Infinite.  All confusions, whether philosophical,
 370: naturalistic, or religious, stem from attempts of moving past the
 371: Nihilistic experience. It would therefore be prudent to heed
 372: Heidegger's words.<br>
 373: 	Behind all the dogmas, rituals, ceremonies,
 374: and assorted 'practical' modes of behavior normally found within most
 375: of the worlds religions, there is a common ground that is, for the
 376: most part, consciously or intuitively covered up (no one is
 377: completely free from experiencing Nihilism).  The 'practical'
 378: behaviors end up as another distraction from the universal nature of
 379: Nihilism.  The worldly forms of religion, when taken as ends in
 380: themselves, when taken literally, are indistinguishable from a wholly
 381: materialist, naturalistic worldview.  The finite language</div>
 382: <div> of
 383: human beings cannot ever be in complete grasp of the Other.  The
 384: misguided presumption of 'sacred', as is given the label to such
 385: 'religious' movements, must be recognized solely in their
 386: subjectivity; and even then within the acknowledgment of a complete
 387: skepticism.  The same criticism holds for philosophy and everyday
 388: life with its worldly pursuits.  Any 'meaning' that is built upon a
 389: material, transitory structure will inevitably collapse as illusory
 390: (regardless if it collapses for any one individual).  <br>
 391: <br>
 392: 	“Any
 393: fool can talk. Even parrots talk. Talking is one thing, and realising
 394: is another. Philosophies, and doctrines, and arguments, and books,
 395: and theories, and churches, and sects, and all these things are good
 396: in their own way; but when that realisation comes, these things drop
 397: away.” Swami Vivekananda<br>
 398: <br>
 399: 	“In true faith the ultimate
 400: concern is a concern about the truly ultimate; while in idolatrous
 401: faith preliminary, finite realities are elevated to the rank of
 402: ultimacy.  The inescapable consequence of idolatrous faith is
 403: 'existential disappointment,' a disappointment which penetrates into
 404: the very existence of man!”  Tillich<br>
 405: 	<br>
 406: 	For those who
 407: have not suffered the overwhelming experience of Nothingness, for
 408: those who still find 'something' within the world, these words will
 409: more than likely be tossed away and labeled as 'whining and pouting'.
 410:  To interpret a Taoist saying into the relevance of Nihilism: the
 411: common people will laugh at it, the 'intellectual' will understand
 412: but not experience, and the one who experiences will be left to the
 413: Nothingness of the world.<br>
 414: <br>
 415: 	“the It world...one has to
 416: live and also can live comfortably- and that even offers us all sorts
 417: of stimulations and excitements, activities and knowledge. In this
 418: firm and wholesome chronicle the You-moments appear as queer
 419: lyric-dramatic episodes.”  Buber<br>
 420: <br>
 421: 	“But along with this
 422: tranquilization, which forces Dasein away from its death, the “they”
 423: at the same time puts itself in the right and makes itself
 424: respectable by tacitly regulating the way in which one has to comport
 425: oneself towards death. It is already a matter of public acceptance
 426: that ‘thinking about death’ is a cowardly fear, a sign of
 427: insecurity on the part of Dasein, and a sombre way of fleeing from
 428: the world. The “they” does not permit us the courage for anxiety
 429: in the face of death.”  Heidegger<br>
 430: <br>
 431: 	“This ‘movement’
 432: of Dasein in its own Being, we call its “downward plunge”. Dasein
 433: plunges out of itself into itself, into the groundlessness and
 434: nullity of inauthentic everydayness. But this plunge remains hidden
 435: from Dasein by the way things have been publicly interpreted, so much
 436: so, indeed, that it gets interpreted as a way of ‘ascending’ and
 437: ‘living concretely’.”  Heidegger<br>
 438: <br>
 439: 	If Nihilism is, as
 440: we claim, the ground for all Transcendent thinking, we must first put
 441: an emphasis on the direct experience of Nihilism.  Swami
 442: Vivekananda's words speak to this: <br>
 443: <br>
 444: 	“In one form or
 445: another, we are all in it. It is a most difficult and intricate state
 446: of things to understand. It has been preached in every country,
 447: taught everywhere, but only believed in by a few, because until we
 448: get the experiences ourselves we cannot believe in it (my emphasis).
 449: What does it show? Something very terrible. For it is all futile.
 450: Time, the avenger of everything, comes, and nothing is left. He
 451: swallows up the saint and the sinner, the king and the peasant, the
 452: beautiful and the ugly; he leaves nothing. Everything is rushing
 453: towards that one goal, destruction. Our knowledge, our arts, our
 454: sciences, everything is rushing towards it. None can stem the tide,
 455: none can hold it back for a minute. We may try to forget it, in the
 456: same way that persons in a plague-stricken city try to create
 457: oblivion by drinking, dancing, and other vain attempts, and so
 458: becoming paralysed. So we are trying to forget, trying to create
 459: oblivion by all sorts of sense-pleasures.”  <br>
 460: <br>
 461: 	Nietzsche,
 462: the so-called 'Nihilistic-Prophet', also stresses the need for the
 463: experience of Nihilism.  In his words: “...because nihilism
 464: represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and
 465: ideals— because we must experience nihilism before we can find out
 466: what value these 'values' really had.”<br>
 467: <br>
 468: 	”It might seem
 469: frightful to any one who does not realize the nothingness and
 470: absurdity of an isolated personal life, and who believes that he will
 471: never die. But I know that my life, considered in relation to my
 472: individual happiness, is, taken by itself, a stupendous farce, and
 473: that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death.” 
 474: Tolstoy<br>
 475: <br>
 476: 	“Suddenly every vain hope became worthless to
 477: me.”  St. Augustine<br>
 478: <br>
 479: 	Tønnessen supplies a vivid example
 480: of the primacy of experience: <br>
 481: <br>
 482: 	“Another question...is
 483: the question of whether such insights can be taught...The so-called
 484: 'engaged' discourse introduced in heart-philosophy admits of a third
 485: component which we may tentatively designate the degree of
 486: integration of knowledge.  An example will indicate what may be meant
 487: by the expressions “integrated” and “integration”...the Finns
 488: caught a Russian spy...He knew the outcome...When finally the death
 489: sentence is pronounced, he completely collapses.  What on earth
 490: happened?  He knew the outcome with absolute certainty.  We should
 491: want to say the spy knows about his immanent death now, in a new and
 492: terrifying way.  He has suddenly obtained an insight, a knowledge
 493: which penetrates him, goes through bones and marrow and violently
 494: shakes up the total personality structure into its deepest and
 495: darkest labyrinths.  Unfortunately, this “integration” of
 496: knowledge cannot be taught in any ordinary sense of
 497: teaching.”<br>
 498: 	<br>
 499: 	There is a hidden meaningless throughout
 500: all of the worlds activities that are drawn out from such an
 501: experience of Nihilism.  But before going too far, what do we mean
 502: when we speak of an 'experience of Nihilism'?  We must first lay out
 503: the ontological basis of this Nothingness, which can be done in
 504: various forms.  Only then will there be any possibility of conceiving
 505: the development of a language of Nihilism.  Due to my lack of
 506: creativity, I will quote, at length, Tønnessen's graphic depiction
 507: of such an experience: <br>
 508: <br>
 509: 	“They have a feeling of
 510: integral selfhood, of personal identity, and of the permanency of
 511: things.  They believe in their own continuity – in being made of
 512: good, lasting stuff – and in meaning and order and justice in life
 513: and in the universe.  In the most fortunate cases, there is a good,
 514: healthy unconditional surrender and submission to the norms of nicety
 515: and normalcy of the average, square-headed, stuffed-shirted,
 516: sanctimonious, middle-class North-American church-goer and bridge
 517: player, with his pseudo-intelligent, quasi-progressive,
 518: simili-cultured, platitudinal small-talk.  Happy days! In this the
 519: best of all possible worlds. One doesn't notice until too late.  In
 520: short: All is well (since nobody notices the end of 'all that is
 521: well') until one night: the day's work is well done and all the
 522: ships' crapulant fools frantically engulf themselves in a deadly
 523: serious game of bridge (till it is time for the night-cap and the
 524: tranquillizer).  One of the 'dummies,' a champion brass polisher,
 525: suffering from an acute case of uncaused depression, goes to lie down
 526: for a while; he doesn't have a dime for the jukebox; the room is
 527: painfully satiated with embarrassing silence.  Instantly and
 528: unexpectedly he is struck by an execrative curse of inverted
 529: serendipity.  He suddenly, in unbearable agony, sees himself as an
 530: upholstered pile of bones and knuckles, with the softer parts slung
 531: up in a bad on the front side, and his whole like as a ludicrously
 532: brief interlude between embryo and corpse, two repulsive caricatures
 533: of himself.  As for this flying farce, this nauseatingly trivial
 534: burlesque in a whirling coffin, and its aimless, whimsical flight
 535: through the void: 'What is it all about?' The question permeates him
 536: with dread and anguish, with 'ontological despair' and 'existential
 537: frustration.'”<br>
 538: <br>
 539: 	“In dread, as we say, "something
 540: is uncanny." What do we mean by "something" and "is"?
 541: We cannot say what the uncanny something is about. There is something
 542: like this about the "as a whole”: all things and we ourselves
 543: sink into indifference. (my emphasis)  Not in the sense of merely
 544: disappearing, but rather, in its very moving away, it turns to us.
 545: This moving away of be-ing as a whole that closes in on us in dread
 546: pressures us.  There's nothing to get a hold on.  All that remains
 547: and comes over us in the slipping away of be-ing is this "no-thing.
 548: "Dread reveals no-thing.”  Heidegger<br>
 549: <br>
 550: 	“In
 551: particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not
 552: encountered as something definite with which one can concern onself;
 553: the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or
 554: present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these
 555: 'says' anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have any
 556: involvement.  The world in which I exist has sunk into insignificance
 557: (my emphasis); and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which
 558: entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement.
 559:  Anxiety is anxious in the face of the nothing of the world (my
 560: emphasis); but this does not mean that in anxiety we experience
 561: something like the absence of what is present-at-hand with-the-world.
 562: The present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it
 563: does not have any involvement whatsoever, but can show itself in an
 564: empty mercilessness.”  Heidegger<br>
 565: <br>
 566: 	We may also express
 567: Nihilism in the form of a question: first, put into your mind the
 568: most meaningful 'thing' of your existence, whether this is family, a
 569: project, a cause, a nation, or even 'oneself'.  Now, can you imagine
 570: what you hold to be most meaningful, the thing that makes your
 571: existence come across as a real possibility, as being worthless, as
 572: utterly void of all meaning?  I have</div>
 573: <div> yet
 574: to meet a person with even a slight indication of what this question
 575: is referring to.  To answer in the affirmative is to have experienced
 576: a deconstructive-terror that runs through one's entire being.  There
 577: is a vanishing of any ground that one has placed under the feet of
 578: existence.  <br>
 579: 	William James puts it this way: “Conceive
 580: yourself, if possible, suddenly stripped of all the emotion with
 581: which your world now inspires you, and try to imagine it AS IT
 582: EXISTS, purely by itself, without your favorable or unfavorable,
 583: hopeful or apprehensive comment. It will be almost impossible for you
 584: to realize such a condition of negativity and deadness.”  And
 585: although Nihilism is found universally within the human condition,
 586: the experience is still only to be received in piecemeal, which
 587: informs us on one possible reason for why its extreme forms are so
 588: rare.  <br>
 589: <br>
 590: 	“In great despair, for example, when all weight
 591: tends to dwindle away from things and the sense of things grows dark,
 592: the question looms.”  Heidegger<br>
 593: <br>
 594: 	 “If existence only
 595: relates itself to being by being aimed in advance at no-thing in
 596: order to be able to exist, and if no-thing originally becomes
 597: manifest only in dread, must we not then remain permanently suspended
 598: in this dread in order to be able to exist at all? Yet have we
 599: ourselves not already admitted that this original dread is rare? But
 600: above all, all of us exist and relate ourselves to being which we
 601: ourselves are not and which we ourselves are—without such dread. Is
 602: this not an arbitrary finding and the no-thing attributed to it an
 603: exaggeration?”  Heidegger<br>
 604: <br>
 605: 	“Now what does it mean that
 606: this original dread happens only in rare instances?  Nothing other
 607: than this: no-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in
 608: its originality. But how? By our getting lost in being in certain
 609: ways. The more we turn to being in our dealings, the less we let
 610: being as such slip away, the more we turn away from no-thing. Thus
 611: all the more certainly are we forced into the public superficialities
 612: of existence.”  Heidegger<br>
 613: <br>
 614: 	'but why is the experience of
 615: agony so rare? Can it be that our hypothesis is entirely false and
 616: that sketching a metaphysics of death is possible only by accepting
 617: death's transcendental nature?”  Cioran <br>
 618: <br>
 619: 	“No one is
 620: continually subject to the obsession with this horror. Sometimes we
 621: turn from it, almost forget it...”  Cioran<br>
 622: <br>
 623: 	“Now, the
 624: great majority of mankind endure life without any great protest, and
 625: believe, to this extent, in the value of existence, but that is
 626: because each individual decides and determines alone, and never comes
 627: out of his own personality like these exceptions: everything outside
 628: of the personal has no existence for them or at the utmost is
 629: observed as but a faint shadow.”  Nietzsche<br>
 630: 	<br>
 631: 	“Enter
 632: through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road
 633: that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.  But small is
 634: the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find
 635: it.”  Matthew 7:13-14<br>
 636: <br>
 637: 	Even the one who experiences
 638: Nihilism in a deeper form is left with a sense of suspicion, a
 639: suspicion that this 'Nihilism' is still too foreign.  All must ask a
 640: question concerning the actual 'reality' of Nihilism along with the
 641: intuition of 'a something' that lurks behind all Nihilistic
 642: experiences.  The busyness of the world, the conscious fleeing from
 643: the human condition, the 'taking serious' of any particular worldly
 644: endeavor, the lack of uncanniness within the material world, these
 645: are ways in which one drives out, consciously or instinctually, and
 646: misses Nihilism or any 'message' within that it may convey.  The path
 647: may be narrow, but why does it seem to also be 'obstructed' to such
 648: an extreme degree?  The 'falling' nature of human beings as being
 649: wrapped up within the world, combined with the rarity of Nihilism, is
 650: an unbearable weight for the one who is seeking authenticity, for one
 651: attempting a participation with Nihilism.   <br>
 652: <br>
 653: 	(maybe
 654: Kierkegaard “double-mindedness” and James “divided-self”
 655: quotes here?)<br>
 656: <br>
 657: 	“When anxiety has subsided, then in our
 658: everyday way of talking we are accustomed to say that ‘it was
 659: really nothing’.”  Heidegger<br>
 660: 	<br>
 661: 	“Compared to
 662: philosophers, saints know nothing.  Yet they know everything.
 663: Compared to Aristotle, any saint is illiterate.  What makes us then
 664: believe that we might learn more from the latter?  Because all of the
 665: philosophers put together are not worth a single saint.  Philosophy
 666: has no answers.  Compared to philosophy, saintliness is an exact
 667: science.  It gives us precise answers to questions that philosophers
 668: do not even dare consider. Its method is suffering and its goal is
 669: God.”  Cioran<br>
 670: <br>
 671: 	One way in which Nietzsche speaks of
 672: Nihilism comes from a term he referred to as the 'Absurd Valuation'. 
 673: He puts his description in the mouth of his Zarathustra:  “What is
 674: your greatest experience? It is the hour of the great contempt. The
 675: hour in which even your happiness becomes repulsive to you, and even
 676: your reason and virtue.  The hour when you say: "What good is my
 677: happiness! It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment. But my
 678: happiness should justify existence itself!  The hour when you say:
 679: "What good is my reason! does it long for knowledge as the lion
 680: for his food? It is poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!" 
 681: The hour when you say: "What good are my virtues?! As yet they
 682: have not made me rage with passion. How weary I am of my good and
 683: evil! It is all poverty and dirt and wretched contentment!”<br>
 684: 	I
 685: prefer the term 'Absurd Perspective'.  This is the 'revelation' of
 686: the paralyzing nature of Nihilism that comes from the absence of
 687: values, hence making all judgments, movements, efforts, concerns, and
 688: offenses as baseless as any other; we are left with any response or
 689: action being reduced to Absurdity, since humans are necessarily
 690: forced to make value judgments in a valueless universe.  All human
 691: movements are motivated by a value judgment.  Without moral values,
 692: no non-arbitrary human action can be made.  With all possibilities
 693: 'equivalent' there is no right or wrong, there is no up or down, all
 694: possibilities drop off, there is only Nothing...yet humans act in the
 695: world.<br>
 696: 	An aspect of the Absurd Perspective can in fact be
 697: described in an empirical context found within the consequences of
 698: the 'multi-verse' or 'world-assemble', a view that many modern
 699: physicists postulate as a description of 'reality'.  Regardless if
 700: the multi-verse is the 'correct' view of reality, assuming it is
 701: 'true', there are consequences that follow from such a position,
 702: which go seemingly unnoticed by both scientists and philosophers of
 703: science.  In short, if there are an infinite number of 'universes'
 704: and, in theory, an infinite number of 'yous', then any decision, in
 705: any given situation that is possible, will be made by one of 'you'. 
 706: Therefore, it is only an illusion when one finds themselves 'caught'
 707: in some form of a 'moral crisis', since no matter which option is
 708: chosen, whether you believe it to be the 'right' decision based on
 709: intuition, feelings, or from philosophical comtemplation, all other
 710: options will also be chosen, by 'you'.  This turns every 'important'
 711: choice or decision into a triviality.  Subjective morality and
 712: meaning are utterly empty, when choice is simply illusory.  This is
 713: to refrain from getting stuck in the cobwebs of 'free will' and
 714: 'determinism'.  If an infinite world-assemble is in fact our reality,
 715:  then determinism is as true as it ever could be, even if 'free
 716: will', if this concept can even be made sense of, is granted in each
 717: individual universe.  <br>
 718: 	The reply is anticipated: 'Regardless if
 719: all choices are made elsewhere, my decision still matters here, to
 720: me, in this world?”  Let's also not digress into details concerning
 721: the 'A' and 'B' theories of time.  But, we may suggest, in passing,
 722: that if we assume that the 'B' theory of time is correct, and there
 723: is no temporal becoming, there is no privileged 'now'.  Therefore,
 724: your birth is as 'real' as your death; your existence is equivalent
 725: to a movie reel that is sprawled out across the ground frame by
 726: frame.  Even with that said, hapless as it is, there is no doubt that
 727: this still does matter to you.  <br>
 728: 	We can put forth Nihilism in
 729: yet another way.  The insatiable credulity in the way in which most
 730: humans force an elevation of subjective meaning on to one's life,
 731: with a conscious denial of objectivity, shows a lack of The
 732: Experience concerning the paradoxical nature of human subjectivity
 733: and 'deep-time'.  Human minds have not 'evolved' in a way in which to
 734: properly handle the exorbitant amount of time in which science has so
 735: far discovered about the universe and the human situation within it. 
 736: Within the billions of years of evolution, the almost fourteen
 737: billion year old observable piece of space-time, humans have
 738: developed a local, restricted, 'small world' understanding of the
 739: situation they find themselves in.  This 'small world' understanding
 740: allows for most to live safely, 'out of sight-out of mind', shielded
 741: from the horrors that underpin self-conscious existence.      <br>
 742: 	The
 743: 'problem' of the denial of Nihilism, followed by the proposing of a
 744: meaning within the world of 'deep time', comes from the fact that
 745: most of human existence has been completely erased without a trace of
 746: their even 'being here', except if one wants to count what can be
 747: found of 'them' in the strands of our DNA.  <br>
 748: 	<br>
 749: 	“All
 750: civilizations become defunct. All species die out. There is even an
 751: expiration date on the universe itself...the universe as nothing in
 752: motion.”  Ligotti<br>
 753: <br>
 754: 	“A thousand varieties of man --
 755: Piltdown, Neanderthal, Chellean, Acheulean, Mousterian, Aurignacian,
 756: Cro-magnon, Rhodesian, Pekin man -- lived for thousands of years,
 757: fought, thought, invented, painted, carved, made children, and left
 758: no more to posterity than a few flints and scratches, forgotten for
 759: millennia</div>
 760: <div> and
 761: found only by the picks and spades of our inquisitive day. &nbsp; A
 762: thousand civilizations have disappeared under the ocean or the earth,
 763: leaving, like Atlantis, merely a legend behind...”  Durant<br>
 764: <br>
 765: 	“All
 766: the power of knowledge and wealth once made has passed away — all
 767: the sciences of the ancients, lost, lost forever. Nobody knows how.
 768: That teaches us a grand lesson. Vanity of vanities; all is vanity and
 769: vexation of the spirit.”   Vivekananda<br>
 770: <br>
 771: 	“...everything
 772: in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that
 773: safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion. So to live that life
 774: no longer has any meaning: this is now the "meaning" of
 775: life...Why be public-spirited? Why take any pride in descent and
 776: forefathers? Why labour together, trust one another, or concern one's
 777: self about the common welfare, and try to serve it?”  Nietzsche
 778: <br>
 779: <br>
 780: 	To pronounce everything as 'meaningless' is to show zero
 781: appreciation for every human struggle, the billions of years of
 782: conflict found within all sentient creatures, down to every
 783: replicating cell;  what a big responsibility to take on, if there was
 784: any such thing as 'responsibility'.  Is the most hubris filled act
 785: that of embracing of Nihilism?  Is the Saint, the one who renounces
 786: the entire world, nothing but the most selfish of creatures? <br>
 787: <br>
 788: 	All
 789: actions will be erased.  All accomplishments will disappear.  All
 790: cares, concerns, achievements, disappointments, and failures will be
 791: as if they never occurred.  With this fact of existence, why is it
 792: that humans still insist on thrusting a sense of worldly meaning onto
 793: their individual lives?  Why can someone sit there with a smile on
 794: their face, proclaim 'But my life is meaningful!', in the face of the
 795: consequences of 'deep time', and not be seen as psychologically or
 796: intellectually deficient?  The only way to justify such thought and
 797: behavior, in a universe that itself will eventually die in ruins, is
 798: to maintain some neurotic form of justification for the value of
 799: being alive.  How does one justify their stance of intrinsic value on
 800: life, no matter what (for now stepping back from the proponents of
 801: euthanasia or the proclamations of many 'theistic' believers)?  The
 802: 'logic' of life, that existence is 'better' than non-existence, has
 803: not only proceeded without justification, it is rarely even
 804: questioned.  Worldly 'meaning' is dead. Yet there is no 'argument' to
 805: convince another against being able to find meaning within the world.
 806:  One must experience the Nothing of the world directly.<br>
 807: <br>
 808: 	“...there
 809: are two inevitable conditions of life, confronting all of us, which
 810: destroy its whole meaning; (1) death, which may at any moment pounce
 811: upon each of us; and (2) the transitoriness of all our works, which
 812: so soon pass away and leave no trace...And therefore, however we may
 813: conceal it from ourselves, we cannot help seeing that the
 814: significance of our life cannot lie in our personal fleshly
 815: existence...”  Tolstoy<br>
 816: 	<br>
 817: 	An illustration may bring some
 818: additional clarity, even if it does lack any force of convincing. 
 819: Imagine you wake up one day and find yourself inside of a gated
 820: tennis court.  You are there with another person, racket in hand, and
 821: the gate to the court cannot be opened, there is no escape.  Your
 822: partner happens to mention that there is no tennis ball, yet insists
 823: on 'playing'.  Would you consent to this game of 'tennis'?  Would you
 824: 'go through the motions' of swinging mindlessly at a phantom ball
 825: that does not exist?  Would you argue with your partner who takes a
 826: swing at the 'ball' and asserts on his scoring a point?  Would you
 827: regard the 'meaning' that your partner finds in this game worthy of
 828: the label 'meaningful'?  If you could invent some form of subjective
 829: meaning to this 'game', how long would it keep you content?  And can
 830: you change your mind, many times over, on the 'meaning' of this game?
 831:  How long would you stay motivated to participate?  At what point
 832: would you give up?  Would anyone want, or be able, to participate in
 833: such an obscene activity?   Can anyone, who's not simply being
 834: argumentative or denialistic, claim any 'meaning' behind such an
 835: activity?  Anyone perceiving the situation properly would have to
 836: insist on not participating in such a ridiculous situation.  But,
 837: then, what?<br>
 838: <br>
 839: 	“Genuine boredom has not yet arrived if we
 840: are merely bored with this book or that movie, with this job or that
 841: idle moment. Genuine boredom occurs when one’s whole world is
 842: boring. Then abysmal boredom, like a muffling fog, drifts where it
 843: will in the depths of our openness, sucking everything and everyone,
 844: and ourselves along with them, into a numbing sameness. This kind of
 845: boredom reveals what-is in terms of a whole.”  Heidegger<br>
 846: <br>
 847: 	Nihilism
 848: takes the 'ball' away from the game of life.  Each new 'game' that is
 849: invented eventually succumbs to absurdity and boredom.  One
 850: constantly finds new things 'to do', yet are they ever fully
 851: satisfied?  To wonder as Pascal did: why can't humans sit alone in a
 852: room?  I'll let Pascal expand on this observation: <br>
 853: <br>
 854: 	“Nothing
 855: is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without
 856: passions, without business, without diversion, without study. He then
 857: feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his
 858: dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise
 859: from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness,
 860: vexation, despair.” <br>
 861: 	<br>
 862: 	This fact, that man is always
 863: attempting to do something, shows that there is some search he is on.
 864:  Is this purely a natural instinct to survive and reproduce?  A 'will
 865: to live' for no Ultimate reason?  This Transcendental yearning, this
 866: pull towards the Infinite, instead of being confronted, is almost
 867: always translated into some worldly activity.  There is nothing to
 868: find in this world.  People want Simple Salvation; no one wants to
 869: participate in the Nothingness.  <br>
 870: <br>
 871: 	“Hiding facts is not
 872: the way to find a remedy. As you all know, a hare hunted by dogs puts
 873: its head down and thinks itself safe; so, when we run into optimism;
 874: we do just like the hare, but that is no remedy.” 
 875: Vivekananda<br>
 876: <br>
 877: 	“Everything that we do to make our
 878: existence secure is like the act of the ostrich, when she hides her
 879: head in the sand, and does not see that her destruction is near. But
 880: we are even more foolish than the ostrich.”  Tolstoy<br>
 881: <br>
 882: 	I
 883: see a world of human bodies, scampering around in ignorant-confusion,
 884: within the illusion of confidence, all with their own little, black
 885: cloud of death hovering over their heads.  “What a Meaningful
 886: life!”, shouted the man who's heart only seconds later unknowingly
 887: delivered him into Nothingness.  He's already a memory.<br>
 888: 	Tolstoy
 889: captures his realization of Nihilism as follows: <br>
 890: <br>
 891: 	“I
 892: was only astonished that this had not occurred to me before, from
 893: premises which had so long been known. Illness and death would come
 894: (indeed they had come), if not to-day, then to-morrow, to those whom
 895: I loved, to myself, and nothing would remain but stench and worms.
 896: All my acts, whatever I did, would sooner or later be forgotten, and
 897: I myself be nowhere. Why, then, busy one's self with anything? How
 898: could men see this and live? It is possible to live only as long as
 899: life intoxicates us; as soon as we are sober again we see that it is
 900: all a delusion, and a stupid one! In this, indeed, there is nothing
 901: either ludicrous or amusing; it is only cruel and absurd.”  (pg.
 902: 282 journal, Buddha, Pascal, Vivekananda)<br>
 903: <br>
 904: 	If the world is
 905: Nothing, and is experienced as such, what is left?  Madness, suicide,
 906: or the Other.  The 'message' of Nihilism may not be wholly
 907: deconstructive, yet, at the same time, is the 'More' of Nihilism
 908: essentially unknowable?  What is the 'More' of Nihilism?  Are
 909: 'madness, suicide, and the Other' all that distinct?  Does madness
 910: lead to suicide, or to the Other?  Does the Other lead to Suicide? 
 911: To develop a language or philosophy of Nihilism leaves open the
 912: possibility that it may indeed lead to, or find no distinction in,
 913: madness, suicide or the Other.<br>
 914: <br>
 915: 	“And indeed the
 916: Christian is, in a certain sense--in an ultimate sense--a "Nihilist";
 917: for to him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all. This
 918: is, of course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined
 919: here, where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism
 920: that proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian's is a "Nihilism"
 921: that proceeds from abundance.”  Fr.  Sarephim Rose <br>
 922: 	“in
 923: such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles,
 924: friends and even from death. and you will ask yourself if there is
 925: anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own
 926: nothingness.”  Cioran<br>
 927: <br>
 928: 	“But then, Nothingness is only
 929: Nothingness. How did it happen to turn into Something? And once
 930: having become Something, how did it acquire such limitless power over
 931: man, and even over all existence?”  Shestov<hr><h2><em>The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism</em>&nbsp;</h2><h3>-Awaken, Material Nightmare-</h3><br>
 932: <br>
 933: 	“I know that I must either find a way to move
 934: beyond the theistic patterns of the past in search for a new way to
 935: speak of and to engage the ultimate reality that I call God, or be
 936: honest about living in a godless world.”  Spong<br>
 937: <br>
 938: 	“...even
 939: if God did exist, that would change nothing.” 
 940: Sartre<br>
 941: 	<br>
 942: 	“...practical men tell us, 'don't bother your
 943: heads with such nonsense as religion and metaphysics.  Live here;
 944: this is a very bad world indeed, but make the best of it.'  Which put
 945: in plain language means, live a hypocritical, lying life, a life of
 946: continuous fraud, covering all sores in the best way you can. Go on
 947: putting patch after patch, until everything is lost, and you are a
 948: mass of patchwork. This is what is called practical life. Those that
 949: are satisfied with this patchwork will never come to religion.
 950: Religion begins with a tremendous dissatisfaction with the present
 951: state of things, with our lives, and a hatred, an intense hatred, for
 952: this patching up of life, an unbounded disgust</div>
 953: <div> for
 954: fraud and lies. He alone can be religious who dares say, as the
 955: mighty Buddha once said under the Bo-tree, when this idea of
 956: practicality appeared before him and he saw that it was nonsense, and
 957: yet could not find a way out.”  Vivekananda<br>
 958: <br>
 959: 	Many have
 960: spoken of the Nihilistic experience properly, but almost all turn
 961: their back from Nihilism and flee into some activity of distraction. 
 962: As Heidegger says, one is always falling back into the world. 
 963: <br>
 964: <br>
 965: 	“Throwness is neither a 'fact that is finished' nor a
 966: fact that is settled.  Dasein's facticity is such that as long as it
 967: is what it is, Dasein remains in the throw, and is sucked into the
 968: turbulence of the 'They's' inauthenticty.” pg. 223<br>
 969: <br>
 970: 	“In
 971: everydayness Dasein can undergo dull ‘suffering’, sink away in
 972: the dullness of it, and evade it by seeking new ways in which its
 973: dispersion in its affairs may be further dispersed. In the moment of
 974: vision, indeed, and often just ‘for that moment’, existence can
 975: even gain the mastery over the “everyday”; but it can never
 976: extinguish it.”  Heidegger<br>
 977: <br>
 978: 	“Nothing is so plain from
 979: the course of the existential analytic so far, as the Fact that the
 980: ontology of Dasein is always falling back upon the allurements of the
 981: way in which Being ordinarily understood.”  Heidegger pg.
 982: 439<br>
 983: <br>
 984: 	This divided-self, this double-mindedness, is one in
 985: which there is no escape.  To make clear, this 'always falling' has
 986: been, at least within Western, Christian cultures, painted with the
 987: mythological language of 'original sin' (or with a scientific,
 988: evolutionary tale that reduces consciousness and all of its
 989: phenomenons as a mistake or accident).  This unbridgeable disconnect
 990: between the finite and the Infinite has been excepted only
 991: 'intellectually' while shunned, in action, by almost all with their
 992: 'solutions' and 'answers', except the rare few who have the 'stamina'
 993: to renounce the world in its entirety and who hold that reality is
 994: simply an unreality.  <br>
 995: <br>
 996: 	“Meanwhile time passes. If
 997: outward help comes, then life returns to the despairer, he begins
 998: where he left off; he had no self, and a self he did not become, but
 999: he continues to live on with only the quality of immediacy. If
1000: outward help does not come, then in real life something else commonly
1001: occurs. Life comes back into him after all, but "he never will
1002: be himself again," so he says. He now acquires some little
1003: understanding of life, he learns to imitate the other men, noting how
1004: they manage to live, and so he too lives after a sort. In Christendom
1005: he too is a Christian, goes to church every Sunday, hears and
1006: understands the parson, yea, they understand one another; he dies;
1007: the parson introduces him into eternity for the price of $10 -- but a
1008: self he was not, and a self he did not become.” Kierkegaard<br>
1009: <br>
1010: 	“A
1011: thinker erects an immense building, a system, a system which embraces
1012: the whole of existence and world-history etc. -- and if we
1013: contemplate his personal life, we discover to our astonishment this
1014: terrible and ludicrous fact, that he himself personally does not live
1015: in this immense high-vaulted palace, but in a barn alongside of it,
1016: or in a dog kennel, or at the most in the porter's lodge. If one were
1017: to take the liberty of calling his attention to this by a single
1018: word, he would be offended. For he has no fear of being under a
1019: delusion, if only he can get the system completed...by means of the
1020: delusion.”  Kierkegaard <br>
1021: <br>
1022: 	“In spite of the fact that a
1023: man is in despair he can perfectly well live on in the temporal, in
1024: fact all the better for it; he may be praised by men, be honored and
1025: esteemed, and pursue all the aims of temporal life. What is called
1026: worldliness is made up of just such men, who (if one may use the
1027: expression) pawn themselves to the world. They use their talents,
1028: accumulate money, carry on worldly affairs, calculate shrewdly, etc.,
1029: etc., are perhaps mentioned in history, but themselves they are not;
1030: spiritually understood, they have no self, no self for whose sake
1031: they could venture everything, no self before God -- however selfish
1032: they may be for all that.”  Kierkegaard <br>
1033: <br>
1034: 	“Is not
1035: despair simply double-mindedness? For what is despairing other than
1036: to have two wills?” Kierkegaard<br>
1037: <br>
1038: 	“Thus did my two
1039: wills, one new, and the other old, one carnal, the other spiritual,
1040: struggle within me; and by their discord, undid (tore) my soul
1041: (apart).” St. Augustine<br>

1050: 	“Natural good is not simply insufficient in
1051: amount and transient, there lurks a falsity in its very being. 
1052: Cancelled as it all is by death if not by earlier enemies, it gives
1053: no final balance, and can never be the thing intended for our lasting
1054: worship. It keeps us from our real good, rather; and renunciation and
1055: despair of it are our first step in the direction of the truth. There
1056: are two lives, the natural and the spiritual, and we must lose the
1057: one before we can participate in the other.”  James<br>
1058: <br>
1059: 	“I
1060: and You drown; humanity that but now confronted the deity is absorbed
1061: into it; glorification, deification, universal unity have appeared. 
1062: But when one returns into the wretchedness of daily turmoil,
1063: transfigured and exhausted, and with a knowing heart reflects on
1064: both, is one not bound to feel that Being is split, with one part
1065: abandoned to hopelessness?”  Buber<br>
1066: <br>
1067: 	“Nature her self,
1068: apparently, will torment thee, she being always an Enemy to the
1069: Spirit, which in depriving her of sensible Pleasures, remains Weak,
1070: Melancholy, and full of Irksomeness, so that it feels a Hell in all
1071: Spiritual Exercises, particularly in that of Prayer, hence it grows
1072: extremely impatient to be at an end of it, through the uneasiness of
1073: Thoughts, the lassitude of Body, importunate Sleep, and the not being

1079: 	<br>
1080: 	The
1081: naturalistic side of humanity, which constantly pulls one down into
1082: the world, into the concerns of the finite, into taking serious the
1083: transitory nature of all worldly things, cannot be overcome.  The
1084: divided-self, the falling nature of man, the 'pulling' in contrary
1085: directions as existing as both simultaneously natural and
1086: Transcendent, is one that comes with great insights as part of the
1087: human condition.  This split within the human consciousness helps
1088: explain the way in which people cannot live up to the ideals of
1089: philosophy/theology/religion etc. and are doomed to be pulled back
1090: down, in all its depravity, into the world leaving one with a feeling
1091: of 'being guilty'.<br>

1093: 	“The common sense of the “They”
1094: knows only the satisfying of manipulable rules and public norms and
1095: the failure to satisfy them. It reckons up infractions of them and
1096: tries to balance them off. It has slunk away from its ownmost
1097: Being-guilty so as to be able to talk more loudly about making
1098: “mistakes”...Though the call gives no information, it is not
1099: merely critical; it is positive, in that it discloses Dasein’s most
1100: primordial potentiality-for-Being as Being-guilty..” 
1101: Heidegger<br>
1102: <br>
1103: 	There is a never ending frustration within the
1104: divided nature of human consciousness for which the consequence is
1105: described as guilt.  The conception of 'guilt', under Heidegger's
1106: analysis, gets rescued from a worldly stuckness of a feeling of owing
1107: something to someone else or not living up to another's worldly
1108: ideals or 'oughts'.  'Guilt', in its existential sense, stems from
1109: the 'always falling' condition, as being dragged around by a pure
1110: naturalism, as not even attempting to recognize the possibility of
1111: one's True-Self.  Guilt is not for others, guilt is directed at
1112: oneself in the frustrated state of the Natural man who, as Becker
1113: puts it, is both 'worm and god'; a 'god who shits'.  In Nihilism,
1114: others become insignificant and the Original Self becomes one's
1115: fascination; there is no longer a feeling of 'owing' anyone or
1116: anything.  How different, then, is this Self, this inner Transcendent
1117: intuition that 'separates' itself from the purely Natural side of
1118: man, from the Other?  Are they one in the same?<br>
1119: <br>
1120: 	 “on
1121: the heights of despair, the passion for the absurd is the only thing
1122: that can still throw a demonic light on chaos.  When all the current
1123: reasons- moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on - no longer
1124: guide one's life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to
1125: nothingness?”  Cioran<br>
1126: <br>
1127: 	This 'fascination' with the
1128: Transcendent side of the Self takes the form of a renunciation of the
1129: world and a turning inward.   Only those who are trapped in the game
1130: of human morality attempt to 'save' others.  Non-movement, a negative
1131: 'morality', is left in place of the denial of material concerns. 
1132: Vivekananda puts it this way: <br>
1133: <br>
1134: 	“Charity is great, but
1135: the moment you say it is all, you run the risk of running into
1136: materialism...You Christians, have you found nothing else in the
1137: Bible than working for fellow creatures, building hospitals?...The
1138: architect of the universe is going to be taught by the carpenters! 
1139: He has left the world a dirty hole, and you are going to make it a
1140: beautiful place!  That sort of practical religion is good, not bad;
1141: but it is just kindergarten religion. It leads nowhere.”  <br>
1142: <br>
1143: 	“To
1144: have faith one must remain passive vis-a-vis the world.  The believer
1145: must not do anything.”  Cioran<br>
1146: <br>
1147: 	“I know hereby what
1148: advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). There are few in
1149: the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage
1150: arising from non-action...Heaven and earth do not act from (the
1151: impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as
1152: the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish
1153: to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are
1154: dealt with.”  Tao Te Ching<br>
1155: <br>
1156:  	And Luther maybe puts</div>
1157: <div> it
1158: most damningly, paraphrasing the influential figure of 'Jesus': “How
1159: far different from this is the instruction of Christ: that, we should
1160: rather despise the whole world!”<br>
1161: 	<br>
1162: 	St. Seraphim Rose is
1163: emphatically against any sort of 'utopian' thinking or 'doing good':
1164: “First and foremost I radically question the emphasis upon “action”
1165: itself, upon “projects” and “planning,” upon concern with the
1166: “social” and what man can do about it—all of which acts to the
1167: detriment of acceptance of the given, of what God gives us at this
1168: moment, as well as of allowing His will to be done, not ours.” He
1169: reiterates contrary to human morality: “...it lies, not in the area
1170: of “political commitments” and “social responsibilities...If,
1171: in so doing, we help to ameliorate or abolish a social evil, that is
1172: a good thing—but that is not our goal.”<br>
1173: <br>
1174: 	“The
1175: philosophical portion denounces all work however good, and all
1176: pleasure, as loving and kissing wife, husband or children, as
1177: useless. According to this doctrine all good works and pleasures are
1178: nothing but foolishness and in their very nature impermanent. "All
1179: this must come to an end sometime, so end it now; it is vain.” 
1180: Vivekananda<br>
1181: <br>
1182: 	“...it proceeds to 'disvalue' together with
1183: the self the tribe to which the person belongs, and indeed, together
1184: with that, all existence in general.”  Otto<br>
1185: <br>
1186: 	“Heaven
1187: and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent;
1188: they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The
1189: sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the
1190: people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.”  Taoism<br>
1191: <br>
1192: 	“The
1193: slime of personal and emotional love is remotely similar to the water
1194: of the Godhead's spiritual being, but of inferior and of insufficient
1195: quantity...human beings can do something to mitigate the horrors of
1196: their situation by 'keeping one another wet with their slime.'  But
1197: there can be no happiness or safety in time and no deliverance into
1198: eternity, until they give up thinking that slime is enough and, by
1199: abandoning themselves to what is in fact their element, call back the
1200: eternal waters...the modern idolaters of progress...prefer an
1201: agonizing and impossible existence on dry land to love, joy and peace
1202: in our native ocean.”  Huxley<br>
1203: <br>
1204: 	“what should i do? work
1205: for a social and political system, make a girl miserable? hunt for
1206: weaknesses in philosophical systems, fight for moral and esthetic
1207: ideals?  it's all too little.” Cioran<br>
1208: <br>
1209: 	“No one has
1210: power over the body or over the world. That means there is nothing we
1211: can do: let the world exist for itself as it pleases or as it thinks
1212: best; we shall learn, and teach others, to do without the world and
1213: without the body that belongs to this world.” Shestov<br>
1214: <br>
1215: 	“All
1216: these experimented virtues make a brilliant showing; for an instant
1217: they are enchanting like an oriental poem: such self-control, such
1218: firmness, such ataraxia, etc., border almost on the fabulous. Yes,
1219: they do to be sure; and also at the bottom of it all there is
1220: nothing.”  Kierkegaard<br>
1221: <br>
1222: 	The positive outlook is
1223: pathetic.  'Positivity' is giving up, a fleeing from Nihilism.  The
1224: Pathetic person wants to say that everything is alright, that every
1225: thing is “just fine”.  It's to ignore our condition.  In other
1226: words, it's to ignore existence.  It is the truly lazy mentality,
1227: which the non-movement of the Nihilist is so often accused of.  The
1228: Nihilist does not like what she sees around her.  She shuts down,
1229: since there is no ultimate difference in her actions.  There is no
1230: such thing as “progress”, only mere change from one state of
1231: affairs to the next; the definition of arbitrary.  The Pathetic
1232: person is trying to hold on to their secret.    The Pathetic person,
1233: instead of retreating into despair pretends to conquer existence by
1234: never fully facing it; most of the time running away from it as fast
1235: as their distractions will take them. <br>
1236: 	The Pathetic person has
1237: surrendered, yet continues to pretend, to go through the motions, day
1238: after day, with that forced smile upon their face.  What kind of
1239: existence is worse than this?  What a sham!  The person who acts out
1240: in the world, promotes “progress”, actually helps others, etc.,
1241: is still nothing more, regardless of all the kicking and screaming,
1242: than the frozen figure of “positivity”.  There is nothing but
1243: fake, inauthentic movements that simulate a life. There is nothing
1244: but insignificant change in an insignificant life.  Progressive
1245: movements are nonsensical.<br>
1246: 	The negative appropriation of
1247: Nihilism simply exemplifies that the distractions of life have not
1248: broken down for such a person; the stranglehold of illusion that
1249: worldly meaning has is cancerous to the Transcendental.  Worldly
1250: meaning spreads into and infects all aspects of our existence,
1251: allowing even the most mundane and ridiculous actions to be
1252: experienced as 'meaningful'.  Assuming an intrinsic value to their
1253: being, the finite, nonsensical, ignorant existence of the human is
1254: put forth as an ideal with what seems as a complete disregard for the
1255: horrific consequences of such a perspective.  The words of Kempus
1256: have still not traveled far enough: “He is the truly wise man, who
1257: counteth all earthly things as dung...”.  Ligotti makes this point
1258: in his unrelentingly pessimistic tone when he declares: “As a
1259: threat to human continuance, nihilism is as dead as God.”  A
1260: participation with, rather than a fleeing from, is necessary to bring
1261: out Nihilism's uttermost forms.  Why would anyone want to
1262: 'participate' in Nihilism?<br>
1263: 	<br>
1264: 	“I am wrong in saying
1265: ‘security,’ for there is no security in this life; understand
1266: that in such<br>
1267: cases I always imply: ‘If they do not cease to
1268: continue as they have begun.’ What misery to live in this world! We
1269: are like men whose enemies are at the door, who must not lay aside
1270: their arms, even while sleeping or eating, and are always in dread
1271: lest the foe should enter the fortress by some breach in the walls. 
1272: How canst Thou wish us to prize such a wretched existence?” 
1273: Theresa of Avila<br>
1274: <br>
1275: 	 “The general acceptance of a doctrine
1276: that denies meaning and value to the world as a whole, while
1277: assigning them in a supreme degree to certain arbitrarily selected
1278: parts of the totality, can only have evil and disastrous results...We
1279: have thought of ourselves as members of supremely meaningful and
1280: valuable communities – deified nations, divine classes and what not
1281: – existing within a meaningless universe.”  Huxley<br>
1282: <br>
1283: 	Instead,
1284: the unreality of the world is pushed forth in a form of either an
1285: ironically morbid 'optimism' or a blindfolded indifference.  One sees
1286: this everyday as he confronts another unthinking robot who projects a
1287: labored smile as he speaks through his teeth about 'how great it is
1288: to be alive.”  Or the restrained shudder of inconvenience that
1289: comes from one who has just heard the news that a relative or friend
1290: has died. <br>
1291: <br>
1292: 	“only the sick man is delighted by life and
1293: praises it so that he won't collapse.” Cioran<br>
1294: <br>
1295: 	"Once
1296: a fishwife was a guest in the house of a gardener who raised flowers.
1297: She came there with her empty basket, after selling fish in the
1298: market, and was asked to sleep in a room where flowers were kept.
1299: But, because of the fragrance of the flowers, she couldn't get to
1300: sleep for a long time. Her hostess saw her condition and said,
1301: 'Hello! Why are you tossing from side to side so restlessly?' The
1302: fishwife said: 'I don't know, friend. Perhaps the smell of the
1303: flowers has been disturbing my sleep. Can you give me my fish-basket?
1304: Perhaps that will put me to sleep'."  So with us. The majority
1305: of mankind delights in this fish smell — this world, this enjoyment
1306: of the senses, this money and wealth and chattel and wife and
1307: children. All this nonsense of the world — this fishy smell — has
1308: grown upon us. We can hear nothing beyond it, can see nothing beyond
1309: it; nothing goes beyond it. This is the whole universe.” 
1310: Vivekananda<br>
1311: <br>
1312: 	“The soulish-bodily synthesis in every man
1313: is planned with a view to being spirit, such is the building; but the
1314: man prefers to dwell in the cellar, that is, in the determinants of
1315: sensuousness. And not only does he prefer to dwell in the cellar; no,
1316: he loves that to such a degree that he becomes furious if anyone
1317: would propose to him to occupy the bel etage which stands empty at
1318: his disposition- for in fact he is dwelling in his own house.” 
1319: Kierkegaard<br>
1320: <br>
1321: 	“And this corporeal element, my friend, is
1322: heavy and weighty and earthy, and is that element of sight by which a
1323: soul is depressed and dragged down again into the visible world...”
1324:  Plato<br>
1325: <br>
1326: 	“...each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail
1327: which nails and rivets the soul to the body.” Plato	<br>
1328: <br>
1329: 	“They
1330: shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their
1331: girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a
1332: superabundance of property and wealth;— such (princes) may be
1333: called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely!” 
1334: Taoism<br>
1335: <br>
1336: 	The illusory, subjective nature of all value
1337: judgments that pushes us forward, damning us to constantly make value
1338: judgments within a valueless world, with our inability to refrain
1339: from valuations, is Absurd.  As 'solutions' to the Absurd, there are
1340: some who put forth a sense of irony, as suggested by Nagel, while
1341: others assert various forms of 'indifference'.  And while these may
1342: be the closest conception of 'equanimity' that one can seemingly
1343: grasp in the face of Nihilism, this is still only a process of
1344: reasoning about Nihilism, and therefore will be drowned in the
1345: encounter with Nihilism.  Irony or indifference are effectual to
1346: those who are still only 'intellectualizing', rather than actualizing
1347: Nihilism.  An 'attitude' cannot be reached through a process of one
1348: inference to another.  The suggestions of irony or indifference not
1349: only fail as a 'response' due to lending itself as a distraction from
1350: any 'message' that may be found within Nihilism, if there is one to
1351: be found, but it</div>
1352: <div> is
1353: as derisory as requesting the healing of a bullet wound by means of
1354: deduction. 	<br>
1355: <br>
1356: 	“Humanist stoicism is possible for certain
1357: individuals for a certain time: until, that is, the full implications
1358: of the denial of immortality strike home. The Liberal lives in a
1359: fool's paradise which must collapse before the truth of things. If
1360: death is, as the Liberal and Nihilist both believe, the extinction of
1361: the individual, then this world and everything in it-love, goodness,
1362: sanctity, everything-are as nothing, nothing man may do is of any
1363: ultimate consequence and the full horror of life is hidden from man
1364: only by the strength of their will to deceive themselves...” 
1365: Seraphim<br>
1366: <br>
1367: 	“The absurd man thus catches sight of a
1368: burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing
1369: is possible but everything is given, and beyond which all is collapse
1370: and nothingness.  He can then decide to accept such a universe and
1371: draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding
1372: evidence of a life without consolation.”  Camus<br>
1373: <br>
1374: 	The
1375: majority of unthinking humans retreat into a superficial-selfish
1376: interpretation of the religious languages of their time, into the
1377: proximity of their family relations, into the distractions of their
1378: worldly pleasures.  Or as Kierkegaard puts it: “The sectarians
1379: deafen one another with their noise and clamor, keep anxiety away
1380: with their screeching.”  Heidegger says that within the noise and
1381: hustle of the world, by avoiding a confrontation with the Authentic
1382: Self, the 'They' are 'rewarded' with the illusion of 'ascending' and
1383: 'living concretely'.  <br>
1384: <br>
1385: 	“We fear that if theism is
1386: dismissed, only a bottomless pit remains...Many forms of religion are
1387: little more than cultural manifestations of the fear of nothingness. 
1388: That is why people become hysterical when theism is challenged.” 
1389: Spong<br>
1390: <br>
1391: 	“for them there is only one kind of agony, the
1392: one immediately preceding the fall into absolute nothingness.  only
1393: such moments of agony bring about important existential revelations
1394: in consciousness. that is why they expect everything from the end
1395: instead of trying to grasp the meaning of a slow revelatory agony.
1396: the end will reveal too little, and they will die as ignorant as they
1397: have lived.”  Cioran<br>
1398: <br>
1399: 	Nihilism is wholly-destructive to
1400: the world.  The one who experiences Nihilism cannot retreat back into
1401: the world of 'things'.  'Things' are all too transparent.  The world
1402: is dead.  I wish to quote Tønnessen once more at length, due to both
1403: the unfortunately relative obscurity of his paper and for the clear
1404: example in which he describes the human situation:<br>
1405: 	<br>
1406: 	“The
1407: world is what it seems to be to a dry, unimaginative, down to earth,
1408: square-headed stuffshirt about mid-morning after a good night's rest.
1409:  And as for such questions as what it means to live and die –
1410: there's nothing to it, it is commonplace, almost everybody does it. 
1411: We are thrown into an absurdly indifferent world of sticks and stones
1412: and stars and emptiness.  Our “situation” is that of a man who
1413: falls out of the empire state building.  Any attempt at “justifying”
1414: our brief, accelerating fall, the inconceivably short interlude
1415: between our breath-taking realization of our “situation” and our
1416: inexorable total destruction, is bound to be equally ludicrous; i.e.
1417: whether we choose to say: (a) “This is actually quite comfortable
1418: as long as it lasts, let's make the best of it.” or (b) “Let us
1419: at least do something useful while we can,” and we start counting
1420: the windows on the building.  In any event, both attitudes presuppose
1421: an ability to divert ourselves from realizing our desperate
1422: “situation,” to abstract, as it were, every single moment of the
1423: “fall” out of its irreparable totality, to cut our lives up into
1424: small portions with petty, short time-span goals.”  <br>
1425: 	<br>
1426: 	“It
1427: is infinitely comic that a man can understand the whole truth about
1428: how wretched and petty this world is, etc. -that he can understand
1429: this, and then cannot recognize again what he understood; for almost
1430: in the same moment he himself goes off and takes part in the same
1431: pettiness and wretchedness, takes glory in it and receives glory from
1432: it, that is, accepts it.”  Kierkegaard<br>
1433: <br>
1434: 	“We cannot
1435: hide a carrion with roses; it is impossible. It would not avail long;
1436: for soon the roses would fade, and the carrion would be worse than
1437: ever before. So with our lives. We may try to cover our old and
1438: festering sores with cloth of gold, but there comes a day when the
1439: cloth of gold is removed, and the sore in all its ugliness is
1440: revealed.”  Vivekananda<br>
1441: <br>
1442: 	A relevant example of this sort
1443: of 'unthinking', or lack of realization of Transcendence, can be
1444: found within the mindset of a majority of practicing scientists
1445: today.  Science, assuming some form of 'realism', as describing
1446: 'reality' with physical laws, allows one to predict and 'know' what
1447: is or will happen within the world.  However, to stop at this formal
1448: description of reality is unphilosophical.  The Philosopher wants to
1449: ask why the descriptions of science are the way they are.  It is
1450: 'understood' thatd 'particles' and 'molecules' bump into one another
1451: in a particular pattern which produce the physical objects that we
1452: see around us, including ourselves.  To comprehend a description of
1453: things is not to comprehend the 'Why?', i.e. what are the motives
1454: that drive seemingly mindless particles and molecules in acting in
1455: the ways in which they do?  Why are there 'things', why are these
1456: 'things' following a particular rational structure, and why is a
1457: there a 'building' process found within these 'living things'?  These
1458: philosophical questions are shunned by a majority of mainstream
1459: scientific 'intellectuals' who are satisfied with the 'How?'.  This
1460: sort of 'unthinking' is what has produced the 'optimistic' scientism
1461: of the current times.  <br>
1462: <br>
1463: 	“A "scientific"
1464: interpretation of the world as you understand it might consequently
1465: still be one of the stupidest, that is to say, the most destitute of
1466: significance, of all possible world-interpretations:-I say this in
1467: confidence to my friends the Mechanists, who today like to hobnob
1468: with philosophers, and absolutely believe that mechanics is the
1469: teaching of the first and last laws upon which, as upon a
1470: ground-floor, all existence must be built. But an essentially
1471: mechanical world would be an essentially meaningless world! Supposing
1472: we valued the worth of a music with reference to how much it could be
1473: counted, calculated, or formulated -how absurd such a "
1474: scientific " estimate of music would be! What would one have
1475: apprehended, understood, or discerned in it! Nothing, absolutely
1476: nothing of what is really "music" in it!” 
1477: Nietzsche<br>
1478: <br>
1479: 	“One would think that neuroscientists and
1480: geneticists would have as much reason to head for the cliffs because
1481: little by little they have been finding that much of our thought and
1482: behavior is attributable to neural wiring and heredity rather than to
1483: personal control over the individuals we are, or think we are. But
1484: they do not feel suicide to be mandatory just because their
1485: laboratory experiments are informing them that human nature may be
1486: nothing but puppet nature. Not the slightest tingle of uncanniness or
1487: horror runs up and down their spines, only the thrill of discovery.”

1497: <br>
1498: 	“To pursue
1499: science, scientists must be justified by something that, strictly

1504: other breach of objectivity. Because science, apparently, cannot
1505: consistently justify itself, something else must if it is to exist at
1506: all.”  Heisman<br>
1507: 	<br>
1508: 	“In respect to science, which
1509: concerns us especially here in the university, the situation of the
1510: last few decades, a situation which remains unchanged today despite
1511: some cleansing, is easy to see.  Although two seemingly different
1512: conceptions of science are now seemingly struggling against each
1513: other—science as technical and practical professional knowledge and
1514: science as a cultural value in itself—nevertheless both are moving
1515: along the same decadent path of a misinterpretation and disempowering
1516: of the spirit.  In all its areas, science today is a technical,
1517: practical matter of gaining information and communicating it. No
1518: awakening of the spirit at all can proceed from it as science.
1519: Science itself needs such an awakening.”  Heidegger<br>
1520: <br>
1521: 	“The
1522: only question is whether we are willing to fall victim to this cheap
1523: look of things and thus take the whole matter as settled, or whether
1524: we are capable of experiencing a provocative happening in this recoil
1525: of the why-question back upon itself.”  Heidegger<br>
1526: <br>
1527: 	There
1528: is a similar criticism of 'unthinking' to be made against traditional
1529: 'religious' interpretations of the human condition.  Many religious
1530: interpretations of the human experience are replete with theological
1531: assumptions that are not necessarily grounded in human experience;
1532: these take the forms of rituals, prayers, moral declarations,
1533: metaphysical claims, and so on.  However, a language that prepares
1534: 'answers' or 'rational defenses' rather than opening up the mystery
1535: of the Ground of all things must be labeled as a lower form of
1536: idolatry.  <br>
1537: 	These assumptions, as with many religious
1538: languages, are the reason why Heidegger proclaimed that a 'Christian
1539: philosophy' was the equivalent of a 'round-square'.  Heidegger's
1540: thought is that the religious languages that have so far been
1541: developed are restrictive of the human experience in that they are
1542: attempts to go beyond said experience; any descriptions of the Other
1543: is wrongheaded.</div>
1544: <div>  In
1545: other words, religions and their subsequent theologies contain too
1546: many assumptions and 'answers' that shun the mystery of existence. 
1547: Philosophy, on the other hand, as the relentless 'Why?', is what is
1548: needed in order to open up the mystery of Being, instead of closing
1549: it off and pushing it into a closet.  One cannot turn the Other into
1550: the worldly, whether that attempt is through reason or myth.  And
1551: while we are all idolaters, there are simpler, lower forms of
1552: idolatry, since they are not confrontations with Nihilism.     <br>
1553: <br>
1554: 	“So
1555: the despairing self is constantly building nothing but castles in the
1556: air, it fights only in the air. All these experimented virtues make a
1557: brilliant showing; for an instant they are enchanting like an
1558: oriental poem: such self-control, such firmness, such ataraxia, etc.,
1559: border almost on the fabulous. Yes, they do to be sure; and also at
1560: the bottom of it all there is nothing. The self wants to enjoy the
1561: entire satisfaction of making itself into itself, of developing
1562: itself, of being itself; it wants to have the honor of this poetical,
1563: this masterly plan according to which it has understood itself. And
1564: yet in the last resort it is a riddle how it understands itself; just
1565: at the instant when it seems to be nearest to having the fabric
1566: finished it can arbitrarily resolve the whole thing into nothing.” 
1567: Kierkegaard<br>
1568: <br>
1569: 	“...philosophies and doctrines say almost
1570: nothing about death.  the only valid attitude is absolute silence or
1571: a cry of despair.  some people maintain that the fear of death does
1572: not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i
1573: there is no death, and once dead there<br>
1574: is no i any longer...what
1575: comfort does this artificial distinction between the i and death
1576: offer a man who has a strong premonition of death?  what meaning can
1577: logical argument or subtle thought have for someone deeply imbued
1578: with a feeling of the irrevocable? all attempts to bring existential
1579: questions onto a logical plane are null and void.  philosophers are
1580: too proud to confess their fear of death and too<br>
1581: supercilious to
1582: acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness. their reflections on
1583: death exhibit<br>
1584: a hypocritical serenity; in fact, they tremble
1585: with fear more than anyone else. one should not forget that
1586: philosophy is the art of masking inner torments.”  Cioran<br>
1587: <br>
1588: 	The
1589: lack of questioning concerning the Ground of all things, as witnessed
1590: within both the scientific community and religious community is, yet,
1591: also found (maybe most astonishingly) in the philosophical community.
1592:  The lack of the experience of Nihilism, the 'intellectualizing' and
1593: worldly perspective of most philosophers is obvious when one hears
1594: discussions on The Moral Argument for God's existence, Pascal's
1595: Wager, and the Allegory of the Cave, just to name a few instances.  
1596: <br>
1597: 	Right away, in the first of these examples, it should be
1598: obvious that this is not to say that one must agree with the
1599: soundness of such an argument.  Rather, it is that many philosophers
1600: do not grasp the ontology, or the ground, that such an argument is
1601: attempting to bring forth. The ontology of values is shown to be
1602: misunderstood when there is an epistemological response of: “I can
1603: be a good person without God”.  Knowing the Good, if there were
1604: such a thing, is different from the metaphysical grounding of the
1605: Good; to not be able to make a distinction between epistemology and
1606: ontology is another example of unthinking.  <br>
1607: <br>
1608: 	“No matter
1609: how educated you are, if you don't think intensely about death, you
1610: are a mere fool.  A great scholar – if he is nothing but that –
1611: is inferior to an illiterate peasant haunted by final questions.” 
1612: Cioran<br>
1613: <br>
1614: 	“...he who hasn’t experienced a full
1615: depression alone and over a long period of time— he is a child.” 
1616: Ligotti quoting Jens Bjørneboe<br>
1617: <br>
1618: 	“One who never thinks
1619: of the hour of his death cannot make really spiritual decisions
1620: during his life. He will never be anything more than a short-sighted
1621: opportunist whose decisions will have no lasting value.” 
1622: Merton<br>
1623: <br>
1624: 	If an observer hypothesizes death then, from that
1625: perspective, the observer has no vested interests in life and thus
1626: possible grounds for the most objective view. The more an observer is
1627: reduced to nothing, the more the observer is no longer a factor, the
1628: more the observer might set the conditions for the most rigorous
1629: objectivity...It is likely that most people will not even consider
1630: the veracity of this correlation between death and objectivity even
1631: if they understand it intellectually because most will consciously or
1632: unconsciously choose to place the interests of self-preservation over
1633: the interests of objectivity. In other words, to even consider the
1634: validity of this view assumes that one is willing and able to even
1635: consider prioritizing objectivity over one’s own self-preservation.
1636: Since it not safe to simply assume this on an individual level, let
1637: alone a social level, relatively few are willing and able to
1638: seriously address this issue (and majority consensus can be expected
1639: to dismiss the issue). In short, for most people, including most
1640: “scientists”, overcoming self-preservation is not ultimately a
1641: subject for rational debate and objective discussion.” 
1642: Heisman<br>
1643: <br>
1644: 	The nightmare of existence that Pascal describes
1645: so vividly, with his unrelenting claims of the utter futility of
1646: reason, as he prefaces his 'wager' is inevitably turned into some
1647: strange sort of math equation concerning probabilities.  I believe a
1648: quote, at length, from Pascal is not only worthy, but necessary,
1649: since it reiterates this point directly, and also lays the groundwork
1650: for the need for a further development of a Nihilistic
1651: language...<br>
1652: <br>
1653: “And if besides this he is easy and content,
1654: professes to be so, and indeed boasts of it; if it is this state
1655: itself which is the subject of his joy and vanity, I have no words to
1656: describe so silly a creature. How can people hold these opinions?
1657: What joy can we find in the expectation of nothing but hopeless
1658: misery? What reason for boasting that we are in impenetrable
1659: darkness? And how can it happen that the following argument occurs to
1660: a reasonable man? "I know not who put me into the world, nor
1661: what the world is, nor what I myself am. I am in terrible ignorance
1662: of everything. I know not what my body is, nor my senses, nor my
1663: soul, not even that part of me which thinks what I say, which
1664: reflects on all and on itself, and knows itself no more than the
1665: rest. I see those frightful spaces of the universe which surround me,
1666: and I find myself tied to one corner of this vast expanse, without
1667: knowing why I am put in this place rather than in another, nor why
1668: the short time which is given me to live is assigned to me at this
1669: point rather than at another of the whole eternity which was before
1670: me or which shall come after me. I see nothing but infinites on all
1671: sides, which surround me as an atom, and as a shadow which endures
1672: only for an instant and returns no more. All I know is that I must
1673: soon die, but what I know least is this very death which I cannot
1674: escape...Such is my state, full of weakness and uncertainty. And from
1675: all this I conclude that I ought to spend all the days of my life
1676: without caring to inquire into what must happen to me. Perhaps I
1677: might find some solution to my doubts, but I will not take the
1678: trouble, nor take a step to seek it; and after treating with scorn
1679: those who are concerned with this care, I will go without foresight
1680: and without fear to try the great event, and let myself be led
1681: carelessly to death, uncertain of the eternity of my future state."
1682: Who would desire to have for a friend a man who talks in this
1683: fashion?”  <br>
1684: 	<br>
1685: 	This is Pascal's Wager.  The
1686: 'intellectuals' who mutate Pascal's insights into the human condition
1687: into a strange math problem concerning probabilities misses the
1688: entire environment in which the wager is put forth.  This is not a
1689: casual decision made from acute calculations of 'finite losses' and
1690: 'infinite gains'.  That is propaganda language on Pascal's part.  As
1691: you can see from his own words above, all finitudes fall under the
1692: category of 'lost'.  There are no winners here.  One cannot find what
1693: one is looking for in this nightmarish existence. This is Pascal's
1694: Wager.<br>
1695: 	Another example is Plato's Allegory of the Cave when it
1696: is taken as no more than 'myth' that has no direct correlation to
1697: reality and seen with no more 'validity' than any another story
1698: contained within a 'religious' text.  For instance, with reference to
1699: Plato's Cave, the same can be said about roller-coasters.  Imagine
1700: there is a builder who constructs a roller-coaster.  The builder,
1701: however, never actually steps foot on the ride.  If one was to ask
1702: the builder what his roller-coaster was like, what an experience of
1703: riding the roller-coaster was like, any attempt to explain the
1704: experience, regardless of the builder's knowledge of every dip, turn,
1705: curve, and flip, would lack any particular substance.  <br>
1706: 	This is
1707: the exact situation most philosophers are in when they speak of
1708: Plato's Cave as 'only' a 'myth', while up at their 'prestigious'
1709: lecterns.  Their lack of direct experience turns any words spewed out
1710: to be covered in ignorance at best, and dogmatism at worst.   This is
1711: an empirical example of how the worldly, materialistic thinking has
1712: affected even the ones who are supposed to be the 'questioners of
1713: truth' on its deepest levels<br>
1714: 	As we will see when we come to our
1715: fuller discussion of mysticism and Entheogenic experiences, the cave
1716: allegory, as a transcendent reality, is not the type of thing that is
1717: 'believed in' or to be taken as a mere metaphor, rather it is
1718: something to be experienced first hand.  When used in the proper set
1719: (environment) and setting (proper psychological preparation for
1720: participation in the experience of the Other) an uncanny world opens
1721: up that leaves any naturalistic interpretation feeling inadequate, if
1722: not utterly wrongheaded.</div>
1723: <div> 
1724: Without making claims about the mystical-type experience 'proving' a
1725: Transcendent reality, there is a correlation between the experience
1726: and the knower that may be useful for our purposes.   <br>
1727: 	This
1728: sentiment may be able to be made more clear with a mentioning of
1729: 'uncanniness'.  The feeling that one is 'at home' here in the world
1730: is one that is the most common view of human experience. The casual
1731: nature in which humans scurry from one project to the next, one
1732: pursuit of 'happiness' after another, is the way the world operates
1733: on the whole.  The question that a philosopher might ask is something
1734: along these lines: what is there to be 'casual' about with regards to
1735: flying around on a rock at 40,000 miles an hour, around a fireball
1736: 'about' to explode causing utter annihilation, in the 'middle' of a
1737: possibly endless void, in a possible infinitude of space and time? 
1738: <br>
1739: 	That there are 'miles per hour', that there are physical
1740: 'things', that one has hands to type, made of what we refer to as
1741: 'flesh', and on and on...these are all assumptions taken as 'normal'.
1742:  That you are reading these words and that they are impregnating your
1743: brain immediately as each word, one after the other, is read.  Put
1744: simply, there is nothing to be casual about.   Zapffe finds this
1745: 'casualness' counter to the fundamental human condition. He writes:
1746: “Such a ‘feeling of cosmic panic’ is pivotal to every human
1747: mind.”  Conversely, a fleeing from such panic, without any
1748: questioning of a deeper “Why?', is also 'pivotal' to every human
1749: mind.<br>
1750: 	In the life-story of Buddha, one hears Kierkegaard's
1751: echo: "Oh worldly men! how fatally deluded! beholding everywhere
1752: the body brought to dust, yet everywhere the more carelessly living;
1753: the heart is neither lifeless wood nor stone, and yet it thinks not
1754: 'all is vanishing!'" Then turning, he directed his chariot to go
1755: back, and no longer waste his time in wandering. How could he, whilst
1756: in fear of instant death, go wandering here and there with lightened
1757: heart!”<br>
1758: <br>
1759: 	“Certain facts of which too keen a perception
1760: would act detrimentally to the life-force are, for most men,
1761: impossible of realization: i.e. , the uncertainty of life, the decay
1762: of the body, the vanity of all things under the sun. When we are in
1763: good health, we all feel very real, solid, and permanent; and this is
1764: of all our illusions the most ridiculous, and also the most obviously
1765: useful from the point of view of the efficiency and preservation of
1766: the race.”  Underhill<br>
1767: 	<br>
1768: 	To overcome would be to be a
1769: god.  Nietzsche's Uberman, Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith, Heidegger's
1770: Equanimity, Vivekananda's wholly unselfish being, all are ideals that
1771: cannot be reached, at least in the form of which human beings
1772: presently exist.  The mystics also attempt to claim a
1773: 'reconciliation', but this is only done in the possibility of
1774: forgetting the human situation in their fleeting moments of ecstasy. 
1775: Regardless of the validity of mystical-type experiences, which do
1776: seem to hold as a foundational element of human experience, these
1777: experiences are drowned in the experience of Nihilism. 
1778: Meaninglessness subsumes mysticism.  Tillich expresses this precisely
1779: as an aspect of his philosophy: “The experience of meaninglessness
1780: is more radical than mysticism.  Therefore it transcends the mystical
1781: experience.”  <br>
1782: 	Tillich, with all his comprehensive words on
1783: Nihilism, is still working within his brand of Christianity.  This
1784: undue emphasis on worldly 'courage', both by himself and his readers,
1785: comes off, at best, as suspect.  Is Tillich's worldly conception of
1786: 'courage' only to be held by those who have only either
1787: 'intellectualized' Nihilism or who are attempting to flee it? 
1788: Tillich's own words suggest something is being lost in translation
1789: when he describes the role of meaninglessness as fundamental to the
1790: 'meaning of life': <br>
1791: <br>
1792: 	“The answer must accept, as its
1793: precondition, the state of meaninglessness.  It is not an answer if
1794: it demands the removal of this state; for that is just what cannot be
1795: done.  He who is in the grip of doubt and meaninglessness cannot
1796: liberate himself from this grip but he asks for an answer which is
1797: valid within and not outside the situation of despair. He asks for
1798: the ultimate foundation of what we have called the 'courage of
1799: despair.'  There is only one possible answer, if one does not try to
1800: escape the question; namely that the acceptance of despair is in
1801: itself faith.  In this situation the meaning of life is reduced to
1802: despair about the meaning of life.”<br>
1803: 	<br>
1804: 	How does one
1805: square an emphasis on 'courage' with the rest of Tillich's philosophy
1806: that is built, one could argue entirely, upon despair and
1807: meaninglessness, as anything more than a conjuring illusion for
1808: everyday people?  Does Tillich believe his own words?  Is Tillich
1809: preaching a 'happy' message for the masses, instead of a 'truth' that
1810: he in the end holds to?  As he was preaching 'courage', did he forget
1811: the Protestant King's words?  “God forbid! Even if God were to
1812: offer me paradise in order that I might last forty more years in this
1813: life, I wouldn't want it.  I'd rather hire a hangman to knock my head
1814: off.  That's how bad the world is now.  It's full of nothing but
1815: devils, so that one can't with anything better than a blessed end and
1816: to get away.  Nor do I bother with physicians.”  <br>
1817: 	And how
1818: about Vivekananda, who Tillich shares a great part of his philosophy
1819: with?  “I hate this world, this dream, this horrible nightmare with
1820: its churches and chicaneries, its books and blackguardisms, its fair
1821: faces and false hearts, its howling righteousness on the surface and
1822: utter hollowness beneath, and, above all, its sanctified
1823: shopkeeping.”  Does Tillich actually believe that this 'courage' of
1824: facing the necessary idolatrous nature of concrete religious symbols
1825: takes priority over suicide?  Is this just a facade or another
1826: example of fleeing from Nihilism?  Does he truly believe in it?  Or,
1827: even if all are touched by the Nihilistic experience, however
1828: lightly, is he preaching to the masses who are mostly ignorantly
1829: fleeing from the experience of Nothingness?<br>
1830: <br>
1831: 	“See how we
1832: are flying like hunted hares from all that is terrible, and like
1833: them, hiding our heads and thinking we are safe. See how the whole
1834: world is flying from everything terrible.” Vivekananda<br>
1835: <br>
1836: 	Ultimate
1837: skepticism and doubt are built in to the syntax of Nihilism, even in
1838: the instances of those few who have experienced something mystical
1839: and wish to interpret their experience as Transcendent.  This
1840: interpretation of Nihilism is essentially locked into the human
1841: situation which is, at least in part, naturalistic.  Even if one is
1842: let out of this 'prison-house' for a short period of recreation, one
1843: must be thrown back into the cell of the Nothing of the world; this
1844: is until death allows for a full escape into the Nothingness.  As
1845: Pascal realized: “scepticism helps religion.”<br>
1846: <br>
1847: 	“If
1848: you believe in God, you are mad without having gone mad.” 
1849: Cioran<br>
1850: <br>
1851: 	“Those who believe that they believe in God, but
1852: without any passion in their heart, without anguish of mind, without
1853: uncertainty, without doubt, without an element of despair even in
1854: their consolation, believe only in the God-Idea, not in God Himself.”
1855:  Unamuno <br>
1856: <br>
1857: 	'Who wants God?  That is the question.  Do you
1858: think the mass of people in the world want God and cannot get him? 
1859: That cannot be...A disciple went to his master and said to him, "Sir,
1860: I want religion." The master looked at the young man, and did
1861: not speak, but only smiled. The young man came every day, and
1862: insisted that he wanted religion. But the old man knew better than
1863: the young man. One day, when it was very hot, he asked the young man
1864: to go to the river with him and take a plunge. The young man plunged
1865: in, and the old man followed him and held the young man down under
1866: the water by force. After the young man had struggled for a while, he
1867: let him go and asked him what he wanted most while he was under the
1868: water. "A breath of air", the disciple answered. "Do
1869: you want God in that way? If you do, you will get Him in a moment,"
1870: said the master. Until you have that thirst, that desire, you cannot
1871: get religion, however you may struggle with your intellect, or your
1872: books, or your forms. Until that thirst is awakened in you, you are
1873: no better than any atheist; only the atheist is sincere, and you are
1874: not.”  Vivekananda<hr>
1875: <h2><em>Madness, Nonexistence, and The Other</em>&nbsp;</h2><h3>-The Suicide of the Renouncer-</h3><br>“Our
1876: ultimate concern can destroy us as it can heal us.”  Tillich<br>
1877: <br>
1878: “It
1879: is perfectly possible that a person with 'existential frustration,'
1880: 'ontological despair,' or simply 'sub-clinical depression' may,
1881: because of his abnormal position, be in a better position to look
1882: through the camouflage of life that still is deceiving the 'healthy'
1883: psychotherapists.”  Tønnessen <br>
1884: <br>
1885: “It may be that in a
1886: certain sense, i.e., "practically speaking," men are right:
1887: but they have not the strength to reduce madness and death to
1888: silence. Madness and death can be driven away temporarily, but they
1889: will return, and, having returned, will carry out their purpose: they
1890: will ask man questions which he would rather forget forever.” 
1891: Shestov<br>
1892: <br>
1893: I believe that those who <br>
1894: speculate that a
1895: full apprehension of man’s condition would drive him insane are

1932: “...the ascetic ideal has meant so
1933: much to man, lies expressed the fundamental feature of man's will,
1934: his horror vacui [horror of a vacuum]: he needs a goal - and he will

1937: Well, let us begin at the beginning.”  Nietzsche <br>
1938: 		<br>
1939: 	“Thinking
1940: of God and not religion, of ecstasy and not mysticism.  The
1941: difference between the theoretician of faith and the believer is as
1942: great as between the psychiatrist and the psychotic.”  These words
1943: by Cioran lay out the mindset of this entire work.  The rejection of
1944: the worldly is one that is necessary for these words to have any
1945: resonance, yet it is the most difficult position to comprehend; the
1946: experience of Nothing is so rare.   <br>
1947: <br>
1948: 	“...under the
1949: ascendancy of falling and publicness, ‘real’ anxiety is rare.” 
1950: Heidegger<br>
1951: <br>
1952: 	Nihilism must be properly distinguished from
1953: mental illness, more specifically from being represented in some form
1954: of worldliness.  Although there is much more that needs to be said
1955: regarding this issue, the sentiment can at least be acknowledged in
1956: the words of Becker: “Full humanness means full fear and trembling,
1957: at least some of the waking day...When you get a person to look at
1958: the sun as it bakes down on the daily carnage taking place on earth,
1959: the ridiculous accidents, the utter fragility of life, the
1960: powerlessness of those he thought most powerful—what comfort can
1961: you give him from a psychotherapeutic point of view?”  St. Seraphim
1962: Rose expresses the distinction this way: “Nihilism is, most
1963: profoundly, a spiritual disorder, and it can be overcome only by
1964: spiritual means; and there has been no attempt whatever in the
1965: contemporary world to apply such means.” <br>
1966: 	Mitchell Heisman
1967: also damns any attempt at relating psychology or 'religion' to
1968: Nihilism.  Nihilism expresses the fundamental, 'incurable' ground of
1969: the human condition:<br>
1970: <br>
1971: 	“Can the meaninglessness of
1972: existence be cured with therapy?  Lie therapy, whether religious or
1973: secular, is overwhelmingly the normative state of the human race. 
1974: Put another way, there may be sound psychological reasons why radical
1975: nihilism is not a condition prescribed by therapists.  Yet if
1976: psychologists are scientists, and their own methodology confirms the
1977: scientific view of human beings as material things in motion, on what
1978: grounds can they criticize nihilism in itself?  Only insofar as
1979: psychologists are not scientists; insofar as they are non-objective
1980: partisans of the ‘life party’, psychologists fundamentally are
1981: irrevocably biased against consideration of my point of view.
1982: Psychological explanations can be used, not only to evade the
1983: nihilistic, but to evade the scientific equation of the larger
1984: material world with a material view of one’s own mind — and thus
1985: to misunderstand the problem.”  <br>
1986: 	<br>
1987: 	How does madness and
1988: suicide relate to Nihilism?  Are madness and suicide necessary
1989: consequences of Nihilism?  If  madness is related to Nihilism, is it
1990: to be welcomed, or even pursued?  Is  there a difference between a
1991: worldly suicide and a suicide resulting from Nihilism?  Is there a
1992: difference of a particular 'irrational' neurosis and the terror that
1993: comes from the insights of an experience of Nihilism? <br>
1994: 	There is
1995: one well-documented case of suicide due to Nihilism in the writing of
1996: Mitchell Heisman who lived out Nihilism. seemingly, in its lack of
1997: Transcendence.  Heisman asks: “Can one live a philosophy of the
1998: nihilistic, reconciling meaninglessness with every thought and
1999: emotion at every moment? If active unbelief were the highest
2000: organizing principle of a life, would the consequence be rational
2001: self-destruction? Could suicide represent the pinnacle of the
2002: rational life realized?”  His suicide suggests the impossibility of
2003: such an existence; or rather the utter rationality of suicide in a
2004: non-rational world. <br>
2005: 	In his two-thousand page suicide note,
2006: Heisman expresses a propulsion towards a new language of Nihilism
2007: that though he may have been seeking after, he could not find.  He
2008: describes his ambitions accordingly: “The implications of life’s
2009: meaninglessness have not been elicited with sufficient ruthlessness.
2010: My methodology is honesty to the point of absurdity; honesty without
2011: mercy; honesty unprejudiced by morals, aesthetics, faith, or hope.
2012: When all illusions have been dispelled, at the end of overcoming
2013: subjectivities, biases, and prejudices towards life, one encounters
2014: the possibility of rational negation of self-interest; rational
2015: self-annihilation; rational self-destruction. The experiment in
2016: nihilism is to seek out precisely those truths that are most deadly
2017: and destructive to me. To will death through truth and truth through
2018: death.”  ('possibility' of rational self-destruction?  Ha!  Isn't
2019: that  adorable?)<br>
2020: 	Underhill, a hundred-years earlier, describes
2021: the seemingly necessary nature of an undertaking such that Heisman
2022: pursued: “But the true intellectualist, who concedes nothing to
2023: instinct or emotion, is obliged in the end to adopt some form of
2024: sceptical philosophy. The horrors of nihilism, in fact, can only be
2025: escaped by the exercise of faith...”  All the same, Heisman lacked
2026: such a applicable language of 'faith'.  Is there anything behind this
2027: thought that drives two thinkers, as seemingly as diverse as Heisman
2028: and Underhill, that has been forgotten amongst the busyness of the
2029: world, which suggests something fundamental about the human
2030: condition?  <br>
2031: 	Moreover, there is the issue of whether
2032: 'something' is missing in Heisman's interpretation of Nihilism or
2033: whether Underhill is 'guilty' of falling pray to the fear of an
2034: uncompromising Nihilism.  One is driven to  'faith' ('faith' here is
2035: used in relation to the Nothing of the world, 'beyond good and evil',
2036: beyond a human morality.  One of the most accurate definitions of
2037: 'faith' in relation to Nothingness comes from Kierkegaard: “...the
2038: opposite of sin is not virtue but faith.”  'Faith' is the
2039: experience of something 'beyond' the Nothingness of the world) and
2040: the other to suicide.  Does one of them one of have a fuller
2041: conception of Nihilism?  Is one of them 'right'?  <br>
2042: 	Throughout
2043: Heisman's expansive suicide note one finds it replete with many other
2044: sentiments that have been put forth by both 'saints' and other
2045: 'religiously' minded people, although stated in a wholly naturalistic
2046: interpretation of a Nihilism that lacks any notion of Transcendence. 
2047: Heisman speaks of denying the self, the wretchedness of human life,
2048: the contradictory nature of human emotions, the nothing of the world,
2049: a possible transcendental aspect of human consciousness (which he
2050: found in the music of Bach), yet the saints lived out their lives
2051: under an umbrella of a religious language (regardless of how porous
2052: the umbrella), while Heisman was drowned in the naturalistic language
2053: of the 21st century.  Nihilism is all-powerful in its experience,
2054: regardless of the human limitations of interpretation.  <br>
2055: 	And
2056: even though he expresses, at least in part, some desire to move past
2057: a strictly naturalist viewpoint, he was unable to do so.  The
2058: following quote from Heisman shows at least a hint for the
2059: possibility of a language that moves Nihilism past a
2060: wholly-naturalistic view, while not entirely escaping its grasp. 
2061: Worth mentioning is that we shouldn't take what Heisman has to say
2062: here in its simplest form, which is tempting to do with the words
2063: that he has chosen (reducing his 'discovery' down to an 'evolutionary
2064: basis), i.e. the common criticism of 'God' as arising from some
2065: pragmatic function which stems from a place of 'desperation', as a
2066: need for an 'escape' from the human condition. This would be to miss
2067: the deeper interpretation of grounding 'God' within and essentially
2068: as Nihilism, rather than as an answer derived for comfort or as some
2069: sort of 'conclusion to the problem'.<br>
2070: <br>
2071: 	“When all choices
2072: are equal, equality is compatible with total randomness. If all
2073: choices are equal, then the choice of death is equal to the choice of
2074: life. If life is meaningless, then God is nothing.  But a funny thing
2075: happened on the way to nihilistic self-destruction. It was precisely
2076: through radical disbelief that I discovered an evolutionary basis for
2077: God.  Most secular people in the West are simply not ruthless enough
2078: in their nihilism to vivisect belief to death. Yet vivisecting belief
2079: to death exposes how the original monotheistic conception of God
2080: likely arose out of ruthless realism. Monotheism may have originated
2081: out of a skeptical, nihilistic, materialistic objectivity that
2082: annihilated the biologically based subjectivity of the self, and thus
2083: created something ‘out of nothing’.”<br>
2084: <br>
2085: 	Now, this is
2086: not to say that Heisman was necessarily 'wrong' in his action of
2087: suicide, that he should have been saved, or that even a Nihilistic
2088: language that I am envisioning could have stopped his suicide.  The
2089: question is: is suicide the answer?  Would a language that
2090: encompassed and embraced the kindred words of Heisman and the saints
2091: allow for Heisman to live as a saint? (Does one even want to live as
2092: a saint?)  Conversely, would a Nihilistic
2093: language/symbolism/method/etc. entail suicide?<br>
2094: <br>
2095: 	The
2096: Suicide is not one to be judged in any particular manner.  There is a
2097: question of how to think about the suicide of the businessman who
2098: just lost his job or the person who has just been broken up with by
2099: the 'love of their life' and the Nihilist engulfed in Nothingness. 
2100: Is there such a thing as an authentic suicide?  Is the suicide of the
2101: one who has lost</div>
2102: <div> a
2103: (all) 'worldly' distraction(s) that they relate their 'entire' selves
2104: to the same as a Heisman who has already discovered the Nothing of
2105: the world?  The person who is a slave to the world seemingly has a
2106: slight 'opening up' of Nihilism with the destruction of what they
2107: hold as meaningful, with the loss of a job or a relationship, for
2108: instance, yet they seem to flee into suicide as a relief.  (I don't
2109: like this last sentence)<br>
2110: 	But what about the one who has
2111: experienced Nihilism and knows that the material positions, even the
2112: 'person to person' connections/interactions are inevitably the
2113: iquevalent to the walking dead?  These worldly groundings have
2114: already died for the Nihilist.  Do we stop the worldly suicide and
2115: not the Nihilistic suicide?  If one has not experienced the death of
2116: the world, then can that person be dragged back into the world,
2117: talked off of the ledge?  Conversely, if the world has died for a
2118: person, and everything within the world is insignificant (Heidegger,
2119: obviously), then what is there to drag such a person back to?  Is the
2120: development of a Nihilistic language of transcendence even 'worth'
2121: the effort?  <br>
2122: 	Is the Nihilistic suicide not the 'optimal' set
2123: of movements?  Is the Nihilistic suicide authentic in the sense that
2124: it is not a 'fleeing' or escaping from the world, but rather a
2125: movement that is the inevitable decision to release oneself into the
2126: Divine?  The strange aversion to one following the 'logic of suicide'
2127: is almost as universal as the unquestioned following of the 'logic of
2128: life'. <br>
2129: <br>
2130: 	“When a human being takes his life in
2131: depression, this is a natural death of spiritual causes. The modern
2132: barbarity of ‘saving’ the suicidal is based on a hair-raising
2133: misapprehension of the nature of existence.”  Zapffe<br>
2134: <br>
2135: 	The
2136: issue is way more complex than this black and white illustration. 
2137: The 'jumping' suicides of 9/11 are one such example of the complexity
2138: of 'suicide'; there is a possibility that these are not even
2139: 'suicides' in any 'real' sense.  With that said, there does seem to
2140: be something missing from the common suicide that is not lacking in
2141: Heisman's.  This 'something' seems to be that the common suicide is
2142: worldly and concerned with the ego, rather than the transcendent-self
2143: (although one could forcefully argue that Heisman was driven by his
2144: ego). This distinction of suicides, and the mindsets and motivations,
2145: can be interpreted in a similar way via Kierkegaard- <br>
2146: <br>
2147: 	“It
2148: is almost as though the Christian must be puffed up because of this
2149: proud elevation above everything men commonly call misfortune, above
2150: that which men commonly call the greatest evil. But then in turn
2151: Christianity has discovered an evil which man as such does not know
2152: of; this misery is the sickness unto death. What the natural man
2153: considers horrible -- when he has in this wise enumerated everything
2154: and knows nothing more he can mention, this for the Christian is like
2155: a jest. Such is the relation between the natural man and the
2156: Christian; it is like the relation between a child and a man: what
2157: the child shudders at, the man regards as nothing. The child does not
2158: know what the dreadful is; this the man knows, and he shudders at it.
2159: The child's imperfection consists, first of all, in not knowing what
2160: the dreadful is; and then again, as an implication of this, in
2161: shuddering at that which is not dreadful. And so it is also with the
2162: natural man, he is ignorant of what the dreadful truly is, yet he is
2163: not thereby exempted from shuddering; no, he shudders at that which
2164: is not the dreadful: he does not know the true God, but this is not
2165: the whole of it, he worships an idol as God.”<br>
2166: 	<br>
2167: 	The one
2168: who sees the Nothing of the world, loses interest with it.  This or
2169: that activity is received as a distraction from this Other that seems
2170: to be nagging at their conscience.  When one experiences the
2171: meaninglessness of the world, this is the experience that one wants
2172: to surround oneself with.  The patchwork is no longer going to work. 
2173: Some people are trying to carrying buckets of water from a river to a
2174: campground.  Some people's buckets have one hole, another has two
2175: holes, another's completely dilapidated.  The one who has the least
2176: holes, is able to get through life, is able to hold onto life, onto
2177: the water.  This is how most people seem to get through life, utterly
2178: blind of their condition, i.e. the chasm of death whose opening
2179: awaits every step, thought, breath.  The person who has a few more
2180: holes in his bucket is grasping to hold on, trying ever so hard to
2181: get at least some of the water to the campground, yet he may not make
2182: it.  The last example seems to stand no chance.  Is there an
2183: authenticity in the final person 'giving up'?  (I don't know if I
2184: like this, I'll have to reread).<br>
2185: 	There are a lot of people like
2186: this who are struggling to keep themselves distracted, to keep the
2187: water in their bucket, sort to speak, with their work, wealth,
2188: family, hobbies, etc.  They feel a sense of dissatisfaction, yet they
2189: keep plugging along in what they halfway recognize as a necessary
2190: failure.  All the water, from all the buckets, will eventually be
2191: lost.  Then there are the people with Swiss cheese buckets.  These
2192: people cannot be held up by any of life's distractions anymore. 
2193: Everything has slipped through their fingers.  All meaning has left
2194: the temporal realm.  <br>
2195: <br>
2196: 	“When death is the greatest
2197: danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an
2198: even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is
2199: so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the
2200: disconsolateness of not being able to die.”  Kierkegaard<br>
2201: <br>
2202: “i want to die but I am sorry that I want to die.  this is the
2203: feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness.”
2204:  Cioran  <br>
2205: <br>
2206: “He points to those who 'do not want to live
2207: and do not know how to die.'”  Tillich quoting Seneca<br>
2208: 	<br>
2209: 	There
2210: is a dichotomy between the logic of life and the logic of suicide. 
2211: One will always speak past the other.  There is no communicating the
2212: logic of suicide to one who has not even questioned, never mind
2213: experienced the Nothing of existence; the experience of Nothingness
2214: is not within their frame of reference.  The vast majority of the
2215: human species follows the logic of life.  They feel at home here in
2216: the world; there is nothing to worry about here.  The one who has
2217: been brought to Nothingness has no way of 'arguing' away the
2218: 'meaning' put onto the lives of those within the world. 
2219: 	<br>
2220: <br>
2221: 	“Psychiatry even works on the assumption that the
2222: ‘healthy’ and viable is at one with the highest in personal
2223: terms. Depression, ‘fear of life,’ refusal of nourishment and so
2224: on are invariably taken as signs of a pathological state and treated
2225: thereafter. Often, however, such phenomena are messages from a
2226: deeper, more immediate sense of life, bitter fruits of a geniality of
2227: thought or feeling at the root of antibiological tendencies. It is
2228: not the soul being sick, but its protection failing, or else being
2229: rejected because it is experienced – correctly – as a betrayal of
2230: ego’s highest potential.”  Zapffe<br>
2231: <br>
2232: 	Is there even any
2233: point to ask why others are so uncomfortable with thinking?! Reason
2234: leads you to skepticism.  Skepticism brings you to despair.  Despair
2235: drives you to Nihilism.  Nihilism opens up the Other.  The Other is
2236: terrifyingly strange.  My misery seems unbearable at best.  What is
2237: this feeling of meaninglessness, if not Divine?  What could possibly
2238: cause this experience?  The fear of madness is one hindrance along
2239: the path to the Other; how demanding 'thinking' can be.  Wouldn't to
2240: be stolen by madness be the realization of an ideal?  Or why not the
2241: 'never-ending' adventure into madness?  <br>
2242: 	<br>
2243: 	“Humanly
2244: speaking, he is mad and cannot make himself understandable to anyone.
2245:  And yet 'to be mad' is the mildest expression.  If he is not viewed
2246: in this way, then he is a hypocrite, and the higher he ascends this
2247: path, the more appalling a hypocrite he is.”  Kierkegaard<br>
2248: 	<br>
2249: 	“He
2250: stands outside human concerns and draws close to the divine; ordinary
2251: people think he is disturbed and rebuke him for this, unaware that he
2252: is possessed by god...he would like to fly away, but he cannot; he is
2253: like a bird fluttering and looking upward and careless of the world
2254: below; and he is therefore thought to be mad.”  Plato<br>
2255: <br>
2256: 	St.
2257: Francis de Sales warns of the consequences that come from the world
2258: when one takes on a 'journey' such as Heisman's: “DIRECTLY that
2259: your worldly friends perceive that you aim at leading a devout life,
2260: they will let loose endless shafts of mockery and misrepresentation
2261: upon you; the more malicious will attribute your change to hypocrisy,
2262: designing, or bigotry; they will affirm that the world having looked
2263: coldly upon you, failing its favour you turn to God; while your
2264: friends will make a series of what, from their point of view, are
2265: prudent and charitable remonstrances. They will tell you that you are
2266: growing morbid; that you will lose your worldly credit, and will make
2267: yourself unacceptable to the world; they will prognosticate your
2268: premature old age, the ruin of your material prosperity; they will
2269: tell you that in the world you must live as the world does; that you
2270: can be saved without all this fuss; and much more of the like
2271: nature.”<br>
2272: 	And then, as if to mock them back, he calls out what
2273: he sees as their superficiality or unthinking: “We have all seen
2274: men, and women too, pass the whole night, even several in succession,
2275: playing at chess or cards; and what can be a more dismal, unwholesome
2276: thing than that? But the world has not a word to say against it, and
2277: their friends are nowise troubled. But give up an hour to meditation,
2278: or get up rather earlier than usual to prepare for Holy Communion,
2279: and they will send for the doctor to cure you of hypochondria or
2280: jaundice!”<br>
2281: 	Elsewhere, he puts the disaster of an unthinking
2282: life that ought to resonate with anyone who considers</div>
2283: <div>
2284: themselves 'human': “Again, while you were dancing, many a soul has
2285: passed away amid sharp sufferings; thousands and tens of thousands
2286: were lying all the while on beds of anguish, some perhaps untended,
2287: unconsoled, in fevers, and all manner of painful diseases. Will you
2288: not rouse yourself to a sense of pity for them? At all events,
2289: remember that a day will come when you in your turn will lie on your
2290: bed of sickness, while others dance and make merry.”  
2291: <br>
2292: <br>
2293: 	“Moreover, it is largely customary to mock at the
2294: melancholy; and in good society it is an unwritten law that every one
2295: shall bring a certain quota of contentment and gayety, or else remain
2296: in chambered solitude.”  Saltus<br>
2297: <br>
2298: 	Suicide need not be
2299: necessary even when it is not taken as an abomination.  The
2300: indefinite, 'constructive' nature of the content that is found within
2301: Nihilism is something that is easily 'confused' due to its
2302: unknowability.  One may be brought to suicide, yet it may bring
2303: another to a 'Some-thing'.  <br>
2304: <br>
2305: 	“...how do you fill out an
2306: empty life?  With women, books, or worldly ambitions?  No matter what
2307: you do, the starting point is boredom, and the end self-destruction.”
2308:  Cioran<br>
2309: <br>
2310: 	“To find that everything lacks reality and not
2311: to put an end to it all, this inconsistency is not an inconsistency
2312: at all: taken to extremes, the perception of the void coincides with
2313: the perception of the whole, with the entrance into the All.”

2317: <br><h3><br></h3><div>"Why does

2326: “How is such an experience possible if the
2327: ultimate is that which transcends all possible experience?”
2328: Tillich<br>
2329: <br>
2330: “It grasps the mind with terrifying and
2331: fascinating power.  It breaks into the ordinary reality, shakes it
2332: and drives it beyond itself in an ecstatic way.”  Tillich<br>
2333: <br>
2334: “It
2335: is the emotion of a creature, submerged and overwhelmed by its own
2336: nothingness in contrast to that which is supreme above all
2337: creatures.”  Otto<br>
2338: “This is no doubt why modern life, weary
2339: of positivism and disillusioned by it, but possessed of neither the
2340: strength nor the desire to go beyond the boundaries it has
2341: established, has made such a fierce attack upon the work of the
2342: mystics.”  Shestov<br>
2343: <br>
2344: “The initial revelation of any
2345: monastery: everything is nothing.  Thus begin all mysticisms.  It is
2346: less than one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive
2347: expression of nothingness.”  Cioran<br>
2348: <br>
2349: “The last step
2350: towards nihilism is the disappearance into divinity.” 
2351: Cioran<br>
2352: <br>
2353: “This is a practical philosophy that needs to be
2354: applied experientially to be known.”  Swami Rama<br>
2355: <br>
2356: 	Is
2357: there some form of empirical data that coincides with the suggestion
2358: that the Nihilistic experience has both a Naturalistic and a
2359: Transcendent component?  How, then, is Nihilism with its
2360: Transcendental interpretation to be, in any substantial sense,
2361: distinguished from Naturalism?  Is Nihilism necessarily to be reduced
2362: to naturalism?  Are there characteristics of Nihilism that separates
2363: itself from, and go beyond, naturalism?  Is there any way to 'touch'
2364: the Transcendent aspect of Nihilism or are we stuck in the situation
2365: of naturalism that Underhill summarizes so succinctly: “It says in
2366: effect: The room in which we find ourselves is fairly comfortable.
2367: Draw the curtains, for the night is dark: and let us devote ourselves
2368: to describing the furniture.”  Is this our reality?<br>
2369: 	Even with
2370: all the strong descriptions of Nihilism that are found within a
2371: Tillich, a Cioran, a Heisman, a Kierkegaard, and so forth, there
2372: seems to be something missing.  Was Nietzsche right when he stated
2373: that there was no reason to convince oneself of a 'true world'? 
2374: Would, or should, Heisman have blown his brains out all over the
2375: Harvard library steps if he encountered something more within
2376: Nihilism?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  <br>
2377: 	(maybe re-word this first
2378: sentence. sounds a little too 'academic'/analytic tradition)  We
2379: claim the Nihilistic experience is in part 'mystical'.  The
2380: groundwork for a wholly Transcendent experience is laid within in the
2381: experience of the Nothing of the world which allows for the further
2382: possibility of an 'opening up' of the Other.  The experience of
2383: Nothingness within (and of) the world does not bring forth any
2384: 'concrete' forms of the Other.  However, an inexplicable, haunting,
2385: sensation lingers within, creating a suspicion, intensifying to the
2386: point of a “pushing”, for one to confront the Other by a
2387: 'clearing of the path', a renunciation of the distractions of the
2388: world, a pursuit and participation with the Nothingness.<br>
2389: <br>
2390: 	“since
2391: i will not die right away, nor regain my innocence, going through the
2392: same routine motions every day is sheer madness.  banality must be
2393: overcome at all costs and the way cleared for transfiguration.  how
2394: sad to see men bypass themselves, neglect their own destiny instead
2395: of rekindling the light they carry within them or getting drunk on
2396: their abysmal darkness!”   Cioran	<br>
2397: <br>
2398: 	“If we truly want
2399: to follow God we must seek to be other-worldly.”  Tozer<br>
2400: <br>
2401: 	What
2402: is lacking with only the Naturalistic interpretation of Nihilism is
2403: the 'fuller' experience.  The descriptions found in even the most
2404: 'profound thinkers' is what we may refer to as the 'diminished'
2405: (Naturalistic) versions of Nihilism, i.e. the Nothing of the world. 
2406: There is another aspect of the Nihilistic experience that is
2407: seemingly 'beyond', but that is not to say incoherent with, or
2408: totally separate from, the diminished form of Nihilism.  Regardless
2409: of the acendant nature of the 'other half'(?) of the experience, this
2410: form is even still subsumed by the Nothing of the world.  In other
2411: words, the 'deeper' experiences of Nihilism that may or may not be
2412: entirely worldly are as rarely explored or experienced as its
2413: Naturalistic counterpart.  With that said, there is a 'wider'
2414: experience of Nihilism, there is a more direct confrontation to be
2415: had.  This is found in what is normally referred to as the
2416: psychedelic experience.  <br>
2417: 	The psychedelic experience can be
2418: mystical.  What is a 'mystical experience'?  Broadly stated, the
2419: mystical experience eradicates the ego.  The worldly 'I' is erased
2420: from its entirety, yet there is something that remains.  There is a
2421: disconnect from the worldly flesh-body that is experienced as wholly
2422: incorporeal.  While there is no ego to be found, this 'something'
2423: that resembles a 'you' remains; yet this different sort of 'you' is
2424: not all there is either.  There is a 'bigger something'; there is a
2425: meeting with.  <br>
2426: 	Nihilism in its fully Transcendent forms is
2427: experienced in such a way that it can be described as an Augmented
2428: version of experiencing the Nothing of the world.  The Nothing of the
2429: world and the Augmented experiences of Nihilism are simply variants
2430: of each other. The Augmented form of Nihilism coincides with what is
2431: normally labeled as 'mystical'.  This Augmented form of Nihilism is a
2432: true 'opening up' of the Transcendent.  There is close similarity in
2433: the comparison to the 'two-sided' experiences of Nihilism, as
2434: Augmented and as Naturalistic, as is found within human consciousness
2435: as the divided-self as part Transcendent and part Natural.  The
2436: 'external' appearance of Augmented Nihilism is one that is indeed
2437: taken as an encounter with the Other, while the naturalistic aspect
2438: of Nihilism is one that 'hears a 'message' that is coming 'from me
2439: and beyond me', yet within the world.  And although they differ in
2440: pure experience, they are not in conflict with one another; they lend
2441: themselves to each other in a cohesive fashion.    <br>
2442: <br>
2443: 	“It
2444: is a mistake to supposed that mysticism derives from a softening of
2445: the instincts, from a compromised vitality...To get a sense of them,
2446: imagine a Hernando Cortez in the middle of an invisible geography. 
2447: The German mystics were conquerors too.”  Cioran<br>
2448: <br>
2449: 	"Quietism":
2450: the difference between the tense stillness of the athlete and the
2451: limp passivity of the sluggard, who is really lazy, though he looks
2452: resigned. True "Quiet" is a means, not an end: is actively
2453: embraced, not passively endured. It is a phase in the self's growth
2454: in contemplation; a bridge which leads from its old and uncoordinated
2455: life of activity to its new unified life of deep action--the real
2456: "mystic life" of man.”  Underhill<br>
2457: <br>
2458: 	“He calls
2459: suffering the “gymnastic of eternity,” the “terrible initiative
2460: caress of God”; recognizing in it a quality for which the
2461: disagreeable rearrangement of nerve molecules cannot account.
2462: Sometimes, in the excess of his optimism, he puts to the test of
2463: practice this theory with all its implications. Refusing to be
2464: deluded by the pleasures of the sense world, he accepts instead of
2465: avoiding pain, and becomes an ascetic; a puzzling type for the
2466: convinced naturalist, who, falling back upon contempt—that
2467: favourite resource of the frustrated reason—can only regard him as
2468: diseased.”  Underhill<br>
2469: <br>
2470: 	“Believe me, children, one who
2471: would know much about these high matters would often have to keep his
2472: bed, for his bodily frame could not support it.”  Tauler<br>
2473: 	<br>
2474: 	The
2475: Augmented aspect of the Nihilistic experience stays mostly hidden due
2476: to a lack of participation or pursued confrontation with the Other. 
2477: Many don't even know that it exists; or if they do, they have
2478: misconceptions about it due to the babble from people who have never
2479: experienced it themselves.  Most 'spiritual' journeys consists of
2480: meditation, contemplation, various mortifications, and so on.  Yet,
2481: even though these practices are performed with the aim of attaining a
2482: mystical experience, most fail at ever achieving this end (at least
2483: in such an awe-inspiring fashion).  <br>
2484: <br>
2485: 	“In order to go
2486: into it, man must empty himself of all the finite contents of his
2487: ordinary life; he must</div>
2488: <div>
2489: surrender all preliminary concerns for the sake of the ultimate
2490: concern.  He must transcend the division of existence...The ultimate
2491: is beyond this division, and he who wants to reach the ultimate must
2492: overcome this division in himself by meditation, contemplation and
2493: ecstasy.” Tillich<br>
2494: <br>
2495: 	“First Bach fugues, a bore...But
2496: training changes the structure of our spiritual experiences.  In due
2497: course, contact with an obscurely beautiful poem, an elaborate piece
2498: of counterpoint or of mathematical reasoning, causes us to feel
2499: direct intuitions of beauty and significance.”  Huxley<br>
2500: <br>
2501: 	These
2502: traditional practices need not be necessarily ridiculed as either
2503: inefficient nor as hindrances; these practices are seemingly
2504: beneficial.  But is there something more?  Is there another way that
2505: 'guarantees'  a confrontation with the Other?  We believe there is a
2506: way and that it does not take years of study, ritual, and practice in
2507: order to achieve this state (although these practices cannot be
2508: ignored as they are useful tools for the experience, even if they do
2509: not, in themselves, produce an encounter).  The psychedelic journey
2510: is one that, if properly prepared for, can open up the abyss of
2511: existence in which no words, thoughts, systems, religions, and so
2512: forth, can prepare one for.  <br>
2513: 	If one one wants to pursue, if
2514: one wants to confront and participate with the Other, with Augmented
2515: Nihilism, then one only needs a few grams of psylocibin for their
2516: worldview to be irreconcilably disrupted.  For those who have
2517: experienced this Mystical Nothingness, there is an unthinking
2518: enthusiasm involved which pushes one into a frenzy of confusion due
2519: to the uncanny and terrifying nature that is like nothing found
2520: within the world. <br>
2521: 	 As with the 'diminished' forms of Nihilism,
2522: there is a strong motivation to move past the Augmented Nihilism in
2523: an attempt to cover up the horrid experience of Nothingness, throwing
2524: Nihilism into some form of worldliness in order to act in the world. 
2525: This 'moving past' is the birth of all confusion and discord.   When
2526: one grasps and misuses finite language as a literal description of
2527: the Wholly-Other the experience of Nihilism is inevitably obfuscated.
2528:  One must speak to oneself when discussing the Other.  Finite human
2529: language is necessarily symbolic in nature with regards to speaking
2530: of the Other. <br>
2531: <br>
2532: 	     “...any experience, no matter how
2533: spiritual, could only yield us an It.” Buber<br>
2534: <br>
2535: 	These
2536: words are only a distraction, worthless nothings which are only
2537: written out of cowardice to confront the Other.  I begged to be
2538: 'kept' where I was as I experienced a timeless, Ultimate unity; I
2539: felt 'at home' and infinitely satisfied.  With that said, it has been
2540: over a year and I have not been able to push myself into another
2541: encounter; terrifying bliss like nothing I have ever experienced
2542: before.  I feel both unworthy of 'Its' presence and I also cannot
2543: escape the pathetic, naturalistic side of my divided-self from being
2544: paralyzed with fear from another encounter.  <br>
2545: 	What if one does
2546: 'meet' this Other and yet is still not convinced?  What if one meets
2547: this Other and still does not know what to do?  The real question is
2548: this: what if one 'meets' this Other and still cannot hold to any
2549: delusion set forth by other humans who have supposedly gone through
2550: this experience, nor develop any symbols that show relevance to the
2551: Other? All concrete symbols of Transcendence are dead.  <br>
2552: 	What
2553: do we say about this unspeakable world?  Is it purely illusory?  A
2554: misinterpretation of a trick that is played on us by our mind?  For
2555: one who has not experienced, this may pass off as an 'explanation'. 
2556: For those who have experienced the Augmented forms of Nihilism, it
2557: cannot be dismissed so easily.  There is a something that one
2558: encounters within this Augmented experience of Nihilism.  One may
2559: rush to call it 'God'. Others may dismiss it as the workings of the
2560: 'subconscious'.  Whatever the explanation, it is peculiar that the
2561: Nothingness found within the world is magnified to unmeasurable
2562: heights when in the face of this Other, this 'something'.  This Other
2563: world is experienced as more real than the mundane, everyday world. 
2564: The 'true' illusion becomes what all consider the 'real' or 'only'
2565: world.<br>
2566: <br>
2567: 	“Mescalin opens up the way of Mary, but shuts
2568: the door on that of Martha. It gives access to contemplation— but
2569: to a contemplation that is incompatible with action and even with the
2570: will to action, the very thought of action. In the intervals between
2571: his revelations the mescalin taker is apt to feel that, though in one
2572: way everything is supremely as it should be, in another there is
2573: something wrong. His problem is essentially the same as that which
2574: confronts the quietest...”  Huxley<br>
2575: <br>
2576: 	There is a
2577: terrifying bliss that surrounds your entire Being, without you being
2578: who you are.  There is a dissolution of the ego, the worldly self
2579: that is concerned with security, money, relationships, and so on. 
2580: All human aspects of worldly-consciousness drop out; they do not
2581: simply become insignificant, as with experiencing the Nothing of the
2582: world, rather they utterly dissipate, they are no where to be
2583: found.<br>
2584: <br>
2585: 	“Absence, extinction, and unoccupancy--these are
2586: not the Buddhist conception of emptiness. Buddhists' Emptiness is not
2587: on the plane of relativity. It is Absolute Emptiness transcending all
2588: forms of mutual relationship, of subject and object, birth and death,
2589: God and the world, something and nothing, yes and no, affirmation and
2590: negation. In Buddhist Emptiness there is no time, no space, no
2591: becoming, no-thing-ness; it is what makes all these things possible;
2592: it is a zero full of infinite possibilities, it is a void of
2593: inexhaustible contents.”  Suzuki<br>
2594: <br>
2595: 	To confront, there
2596: must be a dissolution of the 'I' or of the ego; this is what
2597: psylocibin does with utter ease.  There must be renunciation.  The
2598: Other demands that we renounce.  If you are do not reduce yourself
2599: into as pure a form humility as one can achieve, if you do not
2600: renounce the ego, the self, if you hold on, well, then, you will
2601: bring a nightmare upon yourself like never experienced before.  The
2602: preparation of renunciation begins with the experiencing the Nothing
2603: of the world.  One must give up holding onto the deadness of the
2604: world.  The transitory nature of all things within the world are
2605: nothing but distractions that deflect the Other.  What is it to
2606: experience oneself as Nothing, if it is not a dissolution of the ego?
2607:  To renounce worldly desires, ambitions, and any other form of
2608: illusion, is to embrace the Nothing of the world, which allows for a
2609: 'clearer' experience of the Other.  The dissolution of the 'I' brings
2610: forth the greatest sensation of Unity.  A feeling of pure
2611: consciousness that is One with all of existence; it is pure
2612: existence.  <br>
2613: <br>
2614: 	“To the extent that there is attachment to
2615: 'I,' 'Me,' 'Mine,' there is no attachment to, and therefore no
2616: unitive knowledge of, the divine Ground.”  Huxley<br>
2617: <br>
2618: 	“The
2619: ultimate abandonment of one’s role is not to have a self as a fixed
2620: point of reference; it is the freedom to manifest God through one’s
2621: own uniqueness. This monk had hit bottom. But the bottom in the
2622: spiritual journey is also the top. To be no one is to be everyone. To
2623: be no self is to be the true Self. To be nothing is to be everything.
2624: In a sense, it is to be God.”  Keating <br>
2625: <br>
2626: 	“...it would
2627: seem that there is within each of us an enemy which we tolerate at
2628: our peril. Jesus called it "life" and "self," or
2629: as we would say, the self-life. Its chief characteristic is its
2630: possessiveness: the words "gain" and "profit"
2631: suggest this. To allow this enemy to live is in the end to lose
2632: everything.”  Tozer<br>
2633: <br>
2634: 	“The void- myself without me- is
2635: the liquidation of the adventure of the 'I'- it is being without any
2636: trace of being, a blessed engulfment, an incomparable disaster.”
2637: Cioran <br>
2638: <br>
2639: 	“I am sorry sometimes that God no longer fills
2640: us with dread. If only we could feel again the primordial quiver of
2641: dread in front of the unknown!” Cioran<br>
2642: <br>
2643: <br>
2644: 	When is
2645: one truly ready to confront something Infinite, something wholly
2646: Other?  This is not a 'meeting' with another object within the world,
2647: this is a confrontation with Existence itself, in the fullest sense
2648: of the term.  This confrontation is so different that it can easily
2649: push one into a state of panic that will be unrecognizable.  The
2650: naturalistic side of the divided-self, the side that pulls us down
2651: into the world, turns produces a fear that is unimaginable.  The
2652: 'Hellish' confrontation with the Other, the terrifying bliss of the
2653: experience, is something that cannot be boxed away within human
2654: language or dismissed as illusory or 'natural'.   <br>
2655: <br>
2656: 	“Some
2657: people talk as if meeting the gaze of absolute goodness would be fun.
2658: They need to think again.”  C. S. Lewis<br>
2659: 	<br>
2660: 	“...terror
2661: fraught with an inward shuddering such as not even the most menacing
2662: and overpowering created thing can instil.”  Otto<br>
2663: <br>
2664: 	"The
2665: infinite depth repels and horrifies me; the infinite height attracts
2666: and satisfies me.”  Tolstoy<br>
2667: <br>
2668: 	“Although this painful
2669: martyrdom of horrible desolation and passive purgation be so
2670: tremendous, that with reason it hast gotten the name of Hell amongst
2671: mystick Divines, (because it seems impossible to be able to live a
2672: moment with so grievous a torment; so that with great reason it may
2673: be said, that he that suffers it, lives dying, and dying lives a
2674: lingring death) yet know, that it is necessary to endure it, to
2675: arrive at the sweet, joyous and abundant riches of high contemplation
2676: and loving union: and there has been no holy Soul, which has not
2677: passed through this spiritual martyrdom and painful torment.” 
2678: Molinos<br>
2679: <br>
2680: 	“Mysticism revolves around the passion for
2681: ecstasy and a horror of the void.  One cannot know one without the
2682: other...Once it has totally rejected the world, the soul is ripe for
2683: a long-term and fecund emptiness…One sees nothing except
2684: nothingness.  And the latter has become</div>
2685: <div>
2686: everything. Ecstasy is plenitude in a void, a full void.  It is an
2687: overwhelming frisson which convulses nothingness, an invasion of
2688: being in absolute emptiness.”  Cioran<br>
2689: 	<br>
2690: 	Is there a way
2691: to 'guide' oneself through this confrontation?  Music, with its
2692: abstract nature, is suited best for such a journey.  For assistance
2693: with the death of the 'I', to release from the naturalistic side of
2694: the self, the abstract nature of music, with its strange use of
2695: plucking sounds from 'nowhere' with the equally important 'rests' in
2696: between each note, as a form of language, allows one to more-fully
2697: dispense with the natural-self.  Music without words will do best,
2698: since any human voice may cause a distraction and pull one down and
2699: away from the Other.  Bach's organ music, a God-like instrument with
2700: God-like tones, will guide one through the journey with the Other. 
2701: Bach's organ works express fully his meditations on death.  Focus on
2702: the bass/pedal notes, let the highs and mids come at you, and allow
2703: for the Bach, who speaks fluently the 'language of God', to show you
2704: the Other.  <br>
2705: <br>
2706: 	“...and yet it does not matter that he’s
2707: all in bits. The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment
2708: is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order
2709: prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in
2710: the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a
2711: completely coherent work. At least you aren’t lulled into a sense
2712: of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You
2713: have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So
2714: in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of
2715: course it’s dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn’t
2716: get back, out of the chaos…”  Huxley<br>

2718:  	“...the
2719: Schopenhauerian theory in majorem musicae gloriam [for the greater
2720: glory of music] - that is to say, by means of the sovereignty of
2721: music, as Schopenhauer understood it; music abstracted from and
2722: opposed to all the other arts, music as the independent
2723: art-in-itself, not like the other arts, affording reflections of the
2724: phenomenal world, but rather the language of the will itself,

2728: 	“Bach's
2729: music is the medium of heavenly transfiguration.” 
2730: Cioran<br>
2731: <br>
2732: 	“...Bach often meditated on death...Handel
2733: compared to Bach, is of this world.  Bach is divine...”
2734: Cioran<br>
2735: <br>
2736: 	“Listening to Bach, one sees God come into
2737: being.  His music generates divinity.  After a Bach...one feels that
2738: God must exists.  Otherwise, Bach's music would be only heartrending
2739: illusion.  Theologians and philosophers wasted so many days and
2740: nights searching for proofs of his existence, ignoring the only valid
2741: one: Bach.”  Cioran<br>
2742: <br>
2743: 	“If humans are emotion machines,
2744: then music must work, in some sense, like a machine.<br>
2745: Music could
2746: be a form of emotional technology to control my own behavior
2747: intelligently. In other words, if emotions are the products of
2748: material processes, then art could be viewed as a form of
2749: <br>
2750: technology. From the standpoint of this musical materialism, as
2751: one of the most extreme implications of an unadulterated materialism,
2752: lay a possible solution to dominance of my own <br>
2753: analytic and
2754: objective tendency to materialize everything. I began to listen to
2755: music, especially German music (and especially Wagner and Bach), as a
2756: form of technology to counter my own tendencies to view everything as
2757: material or technology.”  Heisman<br>
2758: <br>
2759: 	“Bach is ground
2760: from outside of myself that makes up for the nihilistic lack of
2761: ground within myself. Bach counters my material self-consistency and
2762: its tendency towards self-decomposition <br>
2763: with a form of
2764: holistic-mind order.”  Heisman<br>
2765: <br>
2766: 	Plato describes
2767: Augmented Nihilism and the seemingly 'true' mindset to have in the
2768: face of this Nothing:<br>
2769: <br>
2770: 	“...the entire soul is pierced
2771: and maddened and pained, and at the recollection of beauty is again
2772: delighted. And from both of them together the soul is oppressed at
2773: the strangeness of her condition, and is in a great strait and
2774: excitement, and in her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide
2775: in her place by day. And wherever she thinks that she will behold the
2776: beautiful one, thither in her desire she runs. And when she has seen
2777: him, and bathed herself in the waters of beauty, her constraint is
2778: loosened, and she is refreshed, and has no more pangs and pains; and
2779: this is the sweetest of all pleasures at the time, and is the reason
2780: why the soul of the lover will never forsake his beautiful one, whom
2781: he esteems above all; he has forgotten mother and brethren and
2782: companions, and he thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his
2783: property; the rules and proprieties of life, on which he formerly
2784: prided himself, he now despises, and is ready to sleep like a
2785: servant, wherever he is allowed, as near as he can to his desired
2786: one, who is the object of his worship, and the physician who can
2787: alone assuage the greatness of his pain.”<br>
2788: 	<br>
2789: 	At the same
2790: time, two-thousand years ago, Plato describes the divided-self, and
2791: the fleeing into the world of constant distraction, of the human
2792: condition as if he is speaking of one of our contemporaries: “Now
2793: he who is not newly initiated or who has become corrupted, does not
2794: easily rise out of this world to the sight of true beauty in the
2795: other; he looks only at her earthly namesake, and instead of being
2796: awed at the sight of her, he is given over to pleasure, and like a
2797: brutish beast he rushes on to enjoy and beget; he consorts with
2798: wantonness, and is not afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure in
2799: violation of nature.”  <br>
2800: <br>
2801: 	As has been said, the Nihilist
2802: cannot turn to the dead world of distractions.  Everything has died. 
2803:  How does one begin to interpret this experience that no words can
2804: grasp?  The world's religions may be of some help, but they can never
2805: settle the issue.  Is there some language that can be developed in
2806: order to help one properly address the Nothing?  Huxley sums up this
2807: need quite well: <br>
2808: <br>
2809: 	“...the ultimate Reality is not
2810: clearly and immediately apprehended, except by those who have made
2811: themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit. This being so,
2812: it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the experience of
2813: nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so little
2814: conviction.  This kind of empirical theology is on precisely the same
2815: footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience of
2816: naked-eye observers.”   <br>
2817: 	<br>
2818: 	Philosophy, or conceptual
2819: thinking, seems to help pave the way to allow for a better
2820: 'understanding' of the ineffable, but, even still, there is no new
2821: 'knowledge' gained.  The universe will dissipate before your very
2822: eyes.  The flow of 'information' will come at you at an infinite
2823: rate.  You will be demanded to renounce, to let go, to show true
2824: humility.  The non-movement as a result of a total lack of values, of
2825: an utter insignificance of the human world, goes hand in hand with a
2826: Quietist contemplative existence within the Nothing of the world. 
2827: Why is it that the psychedelic experience is one which ushers in a
2828: mystical experience that confirms the meaninglessness of the world?
2829: <br>
2830: <br>
2831: 	“...whilst in that state of abstraction rising higher,
2832: perceiving there is a place beyond any bodily condition, adding still
2833: and persevering further in practising wisdom, rejecting this fourth
2834: dhyâna, firmly resolved to persevere in the search, still contriving
2835: to put away every desire after form, gradually from every pore of the
2836: body there is perceived a feeling of empty release, and in the end
2837: this extends to every solid part, so that the whole is perfected in
2838: an apprehension of emptiness. In brief, perceiving no limits to this
2839: emptiness, there is opened to the view boundless knowledge. Endowed
2840: with inward rest and peace, the idea of 'I' departs, and the object
2841: of 'I'—clearly discriminating the non-existence of matter, this is
2842: the condition of immaterial life.”  Buddha<br>
2843: <br>
2844: 	If one
2845: wishes to rush to a 'conclusion' and attempt to wrap up the infinite
2846: within one of the worldly religions, in order to live in the world,
2847: in order to 'make sense' of such a confrontation, then one is only
2848: fleeing from Nihilism and ultimately doing a disservice to the
2849: 'something' that one meets on the psychedelic journey.  This is not
2850: about belief or developing a system or trying to box in Nihilism. 
2851: One must accept the utter mystery behind Nihilism as something too
2852: 'powerful' to be confined in the finite.  There is only the Infinite
2853: Conclusion.  <br>
2854: 	<br>
2855: 	One encounters Nothingness in the Transcendent experience of Nihilism.   <br>
2856: <br>
2857: 	“Therewith, they
2858: learn that It is the Cause of all things and yet Itself is nothing,
2859: because It super-essentially transcends them all.” 
2860: Pseudo-Dionysius<br>
2861: 	“In statements such as Eckhart's, God is
2862: equated with nothing.”  Huxley<br>
2863: <br>
2864: 	Huxley further goes on
2865: to confirm the Nihilist's experience of the Nothing of oneself:
2866: <br>
2867: 	“Cheap,” I commented. “Trivial. Like things in a
2868: five-and-ten.” And all this shoddiness existed in a closed, cramped
2869: universe. “It’s as though one were below decks in a ship,” I
2870: said. “A five-and-ten-cent ship.” And as I looked, it became very
2871: clear that this five-and-ten-cent ship was in some way connected with
2872: human pretensions, with the portrait of Cézanne, with A.B. among the
2873: Dolomites overacting his favorite character in fiction. This
2874: suffocating interior of a dime-store ship was my own personal self;
2875: these gimcrack mobiles of tin and plastic were my personal
2876: contributions to the universe.”<br>
2877: 	Why is this important?  The
2878: 'truth' of the experience is one that is confirmed by those separated
2879: by time, space, culture, and so on.  A repeating of the words of
2880: Huxley can be found in the mystic St. Molinos: “Knowing that thou
2881: art nothing, that thou canst do nothing, and art worth just nothing,
2882: thou wilt quietly embrace passive drynesses, thou wilt endure
2883: horrible desolations; thou wilt undergo spiritual</div>
2884: <div>
2885: martyrdoms and inward torments. By means of this Nothing thou must
2886: die in thy self, many ways, at all times, and all hours, Keeping thy
2887: self in Nothing, thou wilt bar the door against every thing that is
2888: not God”.   Molinos further states: “But the happy Soul which is
2889: gotten to this holy hatred of it self, lives overwhelmed, drowned and
2890: swallowed up in the depth of its own Nothing.”<br>
2891: 	Within
2892: mystical experiences human truth, better put, human rationality is no
2893: longer a concern.  There are 'things' that are brought forth that no
2894: human language can describe, that no human being can fully
2895: comprehend.  The experience is one that must be dealt with
2896: subjectively. <br>
2897: <br>
2898: 		   “In life, man proposes, God
2899: disposes.”  Huxley<br>
2900: <br>
2901: 	Smith describes his encounter with
2902: the Other as such: “The world into which I was ushered was strange,
2903: weird, uncanny, significant, and terrifying beyond belief.”  Smith,
2904: describing his experience himself in a Transcendental manner, also
2905: declares: “Revelations can be terrifying.”  The mystical
2906: experience is not like anything of this world.<br>
2907: 	Huxley describes
2908: a part of his psychedelic experience as follows: “And then t here
2909: is the horror of infinity...I found myself all at once on the brink
2910: of panic.  This, I suddenly felt, was going too far.  Too far, even
2911: though the going was into intenser beauty, deeper significance.  The
2912: fear, as I analyze it in retrospect, was of being overwhelmed, of
2913: disintegrating under a pressure of reality greater than a mind,
2914: accustomed to living most of the time in a cosy world of symbols,
2915: could possibly bear.  The literature of religious experience abounds
2916: in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have
2917: come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the
2918: Mysterium tremendum.  In theological language, this fear is due to
2919: the incompatibility between man’s egotism and the divine purity,
2920: between man’s self-aggravated separateness and the infinity of
2921: God.”<br>
2922: <br>
2923: 	“Quite naturally, then, almost no one figures
2924: their time to be ill-spent in bickering about some point of scripture
2925: or a psycho-philosophical poser rather than in sizing up some
2926: superlative individuals who have called into question what we are or
2927: what we might be aside from slaves of our egos.”  Ligotti<br>
2928: 	<br>
2929: 	Is
2930: there any better explanation for why philosophers and theologians
2931: have 'missed the mark' in their sand-trap of pursuing 'rationality'
2932: instead of direct experience?  Is there any better reason one could
2933: give for the seemingly endless stagnation and frustration that ensues
2934: from the 'intellectualizing' of these issues?  Is there any doubt as
2935: to why the dogmas of the naturalist and of the worldly 'religious'
2936: are trapped in a stalemate with their attempts to 'convince' one
2937: another with reason and rationality?  Reason and rationality have
2938: their place, but if there is not an attempt to go beyond, then one
2939: necessarily can only obtain a constrained portion of the human
2940: condition.  <br>
2941: 	Huxley sums it up with a question: “How many
2942: philosophers, how many theologians, how many professional educators
2943: have had the curiosity to open this Door in the Wall? The answer, for
2944: all practical purposes, is, None.”<br>
2945: 	There is no need for a
2946: concern over 'spookiness' in any 'supernatural' or 'new age' sense. 
2947: The particular mystical-type experiences that I have briefly
2948: mentioned are not anything special.  By 'special', I mean that these
2949: experiences can be induced into any one willing to undertake such a
2950: task.  There is no worry of any 'new age' or 'supernatural' powers
2951: underlying any of the claims made here.  Any person in the proper set
2952: (psychological preparation) and setting (proper surroundings and
2953: environment), along with a definite intention for the pursuit is
2954: welcome to 'test' the results of such an experience for themselves. 
2955: There is no need for years of meditation, chanting, yoga, or any
2956: other traditional 'religious' interlocutors; although these methods,
2957: and others, can be used in correlation with psychedelics which may
2958: bring out a fuller and deeper experience.  <br>
2959: 	One is now simply
2960: left to interpret said experience.  Is it wholly naturalistic?  Is
2961: there anything veritical about the psychedelic experience?  Speaking
2962: from personal experience, the experience that one encounters with the
2963: use psychedelics is not only not contradictory with the philosophy of
2964: Nihilism (as laid out in these pages), it rather confirms it quite
2965: strongly.  This does not prove anything.  While one is tempted to
2966: refer to the psychedelic experience as an encounter with the Other,
2967: with all its Transcendent, noetic, and paradoxical qualities, there
2968: is no explicit contradiction in reducing the experience down to a
2969: naturalist interpretation. Regardless, of what one holds about the
2970: Augmented form of Nihilism, we get reduced back to our normal state
2971: of consciousness, left with the Nothing of the world.  St. Theresa
2972: laments: “Oh, what a distress it is for my soul to have to return
2973: to hold commerce with this world after having had its conversation in
2974: heaven!  To have to play a part in the sad farce of this earthly
2975: life!”  <br>
2976: 	“This, however, is the sublime melancholy of our
2977: lot that every You must become an It in our world.  However
2978: exclusively present it may have been in the direct relationship- as
2979: soon as the relationship has run its course or is permeated by means,
2980: the You becomes an object among objects, possibly the noblest one and
2981: yet one of them, assigned its measure and boundary.”  The
2982: actualization of the work involves a loss of actuality. Genuine
2983: contemplation never lasts long; the natural being that only now
2984: revealed itself to me in the mystery of reciprocity has again become
2985: describable, analyzable, classifiable- the point in which manifold
2986: systems of laws intersect.”  Buber<br>
2987: 	“How, in other words,
2988: can one be a saint and still organize scientific movements of
2989: world-historical importance? How does one lean on God and give over
2990: everything to Him and still stand on his own feet as a passionate
2991: human being? These are not rhetorical questions, they are real ones
2992: that go right to the heard of the problem of 'how to be a man'- a
2993: problem that no one can satisfactorily advise anyone else on, as the
2994: wise William James knew. The whole thing is loaded with ambiguity
2995: impossible to resolve.”  Becker<hr><h2><em>The Symbolic Resonance of Nothingness</em></h2><h3>-Subtle, Vague, yet Persistent Echo-</h3><br>“There is a nagging
2996: suspicion that the diagnostics are exploiting Heidegger's exotic
2997: language in order to “keep talking,” and thus keep calm and
2998: unaffected by the horror of the bottomless abyssus humanae
2999: conscientiae with which they are incessantly confronted.”  
3000: Tønnessen<br>
3001: <br>
3002: “What cannot be translated into mystical
3003: language does not deserve to be experienced.”  Cioran<br>
3004: <br>
3005: “Martin
3006: Heidegger is what happens when one believes in one’s own emotions,
3007: i.e. poetry.”  Heisman<br>
3008: <br>
3009: “I know that I must either find
3010: a way to move beyond the theistic patterns of the past in search for
3011: a new way to speak of and to engage the ultimate reality that I call
3012: God, or be honest about living in a godless world.”  Spong<br>
3013: 	The
3014: question comes up once more: Is one forced into madness or to
3015: relinquish their existence?  Can one confront the Other in an
3016: authentic way that is not motivated by a purely selfish need for
3017: comfort or 'security' within the nightmare of existence?  Can a
3018: language of Nihilism, having the duel roles of navigating the Nothing
3019: of the world while propagating the Transcendental aspect of
3020: meaninglessness, as an authentic way to encounter the Other, be
3021: developed?  Is there any place for philosophical thinking in this
3022: world of contradictions? <br>
3023: <br>
3024: 	“Nevertheless, this
3025: existentially ‘possible’ Being-towards-death remains, from the
3026: existential point of view, a fantastical exaction...Does Dasein ever
3027: factically throw itself into such a Being-towards-death? Does Dasein
3028: demand, even by reason of its own-most Being, an authentic
3029: potentiality-for-Being determined by anticipation?”  Heidegger<br>
3030: <br>
3031: One must first accept that one does not know what one is talking
3032: about. There is not one person who knows what is 'going on here'.
3033: Underhill expresses, fully, the self-criticism that this sort of
3034: project is bound to: “If the metaphysician be true to his own
3035: postulates, he must acknowledge in the end that we are all forced to
3036: live, to think, and at last to die, in an unknown and unknowable
3037: world: fed arbitrarily and diligently, yet how we know not, by ideas
3038: and suggestions whose truth we cannot test but whose pressure we
3039: cannot resist.” <br>
3040: 	Could we circumnavigate all this and express
3041: the experience of Nihilism in the simplest of terms as: 'all worldly
3042: endeavors are futile'.  It seems that we cannot.  Cliches, as such,
3043: will never do, since, as Heidegger points out, cliches are nothing
3044: but a form of empty 'idle talk' riddled with 'ambiguity' of a passing
3045: off as 'knowing'.  This 'passing over' is simply another distraction.
3046:  There may be a 'message' that is missed when we speak of Nihilism in
3047: such cursory ways.  If we want to develop a language of Nihilism that
3048: is not simply Naturalistic, that is beyond the dead 'solutions' of
3049: the worldly philosophies and religions, and moreover, that is not
3050: simply idle-talk that contributes nothing more than to a premature
3051: suicide, then we must proceed past such banalities.<br>
3052: 	A main
3053: problem with discussing Nihilism is that there are no words that hold
3054: a tight enough grasp on the experience itself as to allow the
3055: experience to become transferable.  St. Therese of Lisieux explains
3056: her experience within a Christian structure: “He allowed my soul to
3057: be overwhelmed with darkness, and the thought of Heaven, which had
3058: consoled me from my earliest childhood, now became a subject of
3059: conflict and torture...I wish I could express what I feel, but it is
3060: beyond me. One must have passed through this dark tunnel to
3061: understand its blackness.”<br>
3062: 	Is one who has experienced
3063: Nihilism, with its essence of 'non-transferability', now left to a
3064: Quietist</div>
3065: <div>
3066: silence?  I believe that an honest answer to this question is: yes. 
3067: Do we stop here?  We cannot, because we are still in the theoretical.
3068:  Most, of the seemingly rare few, who have experienced Nihilism do
3069: not have the 'stamina' to renounce the world in its entirety. 
3070: Experiencing Nothing and renouncing everything are not equivalent (as
3071: we spoke of in the section on Naturalism).  Beyond renunciation, even
3072: the Suicide, who claims to feel a 'brand' of Nihilism, is seemingly
3073: misunderstanding the message.  The Nihilist is one who uses suicide,
3074: rather than commits it; at least for a particular span of time.  <br>
3075: 	Is
3076: there then some type of 'affirmative' substance that is found within
3077: the experience of Nihilism that allows us to move forward in a task
3078: of developing a language that breaks through what could otherwise be
3079: perceived as a simple pointing out, or culmination, of the 'world's
3080: sufferings'?  To quote Cioran once more on the ' affirmative
3081: substance' of Nothing: “The initial revelation of any monastery:
3082: everything is nothing.  Thus begin all mysticisms.  It is less than
3083: one step from nothing to God, for God is the positive expression of
3084: nothingness.”<br>
3085: 	A language of Nihilism reflects the need to
3086: confront the Transcendental yearning as a true confrontation, rather
3087: than something that one tries to replace with this or that thing,
3088: this or that creed, this or that activity, etc.  The need for such a
3089: language in demonstrated in the words of Huxley: “...the ultimate
3090: Reality is not clearly and immediately apprehended, except by those
3091: who have made themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit.
3092: This being so, it is hardly surprising that a theology based upon the
3093: experience of nice, ordinary, unregenerate people should carry so
3094: little conviction.  This kind of empirical theology is on precisely
3095: the same footing as an empirical astronomy, based upon the experience
3096: of naked-eye observers.”<br>
3097: 	A 'new language' of Nihilism is one
3098: that must be worked out in order to provide a more adequate account
3099: of the Transcendence of and within human experience, as revealed
3100: through Nihilism, without specifically holding to either a purely
3101: 'religious' or 'naturalist' worldview.  With great reservation, I
3102: suggest the use of the word Nihiltheism as a word to ground this
3103: 'genre' of human experience.  This is a language that is not strictly
3104: based upon on myth, tradition, nor empirical facts.  This language
3105: must also not ever be taken as 'complete' ('complete' in a similar
3106: way in which 'literal' would be used with regards to interpreting a
3107: mythical language), but rather as a symbolic language which is always
3108: self-critical and therefore always open for re-interpretation.<br>
3109: 	A
3110: language, as any other, may be able to be developed in order to
3111: 'navigate' the 'complexities' of Nihilism in both its forms, as the
3112: Nothing of the world and its Transcendence.  The groundwork for a
3113: language of Nihilism, at least up till the present moment, is found
3114: in its most 'complete' form in Heidegger's comprehensive language
3115: about the human condition as described in Being and Time.  <br>
3116: 	Within
3117: the 'already-made' language of Heidegger we have concepts of anxiety,
3118: moments of vision, everydayness, the call of conscience, the
3119: situation, authenticity, uncanniness, resoluteness, and so on,
3120: already laid out and defined, that capture key insights into the
3121: human condition.  These insights and concepts allow for an
3122: interpretation of the Nihilistic experience on 'non-naturalistic'
3123: terms while still being grounded within the naturalistic aspect of
3124: the human condition.  <br>
3125: 	There is no need to get bogged down with
3126: Heidegger's perspective being essentially 'atheistic' or ' theistic'
3127: in itself, since we are specifically looking to interpret and
3128: discover a language in which a Nihilist may speak about the human
3129: situation as he experiences it.  Heidegger himself attempts to avoid
3130: such presumptuous terms as 'atheistic' or 'theistic' as they are
3131: taken to be ultimately restrictive for a full analysis of the human
3132: situation.  What Heidegger speaks of 'objectively' must still be
3133: experienced subjectively.  Therefore, Heidegger's analysis may only
3134: be seen as an introductory 'map' with regards to speaking about the
3135: Other.  This 'map' need not guarantee a 'direct' path to the Other. 
3136: In other words, assuming there can be such a thing as a 'language of
3137: Nihilism', the possible interpretations may vary immensely.  This
3138: 'Other' is an aspect of the developing language that will have to
3139: rest in obscurity, not only in these introductory words, but even
3140: within a more developed speech-set.  <br>
3141: 	Without the need, yet, to
3142: go into detail concerning all of Heidegger's terms or concepts, a
3143: bare-bones laying out of the basic structure may be put down in order
3144: to help envision the coherency of Heidegger's analysis of human
3145: existence as a possible foundation for developing a language of
3146: Nihilism.  Therefore, a very brief summary of what Heidegger refers
3147: to as 'Being-Towards-Death' with some of its particularities will be
3148: put forth as an example of the foundations of such a language. 
3149: 'Being-Towards-Death', concisely put, consist of anxiety, in a moment
3150: of vision, having a call of conscience that seems to come 'from me
3151: and beyond me' (Buber- “It appears simultaneously as acting on and
3152: as acted upon”), that 'gives something to be understood' in an
3153: 'indefinite', incommunicable way, and which causes the world to 'drop
3154: out' due everything in it sinking into insignificant, yet which
3155: pushes one to strive to stay resolute in this anxiety produced
3156: experience of knowing that death may happen at any moment, which, as
3157: a result, allows one to escape the 'everydayness' of the world in
3158: order to turn inward with attempts to discover one's True-Self.
3159: Without even going into detail, Heidegger's structure is one which
3160: should not be difficult to see how his analysis of the human
3161: condition explicitly lends itself to the building of a Nihilistic
3162: language.  <br>
3163: 	Is Heidegger's, commonly labeled as 'atheistic',
3164: analysis really at all different from what the Trappist monk, Thomas
3165: Merton, has come to accept?  Merton also clearly states the
3166: bankruptcy of a constant outward-seeking, hectic search for 'meaning'
3167: within life.  In comparison to Heidegger, he express the same idea in
3168: this language: “The truly sacred attitude toward life is in no
3169: sense an escape from the sense of nothingness that assails us when we
3170: are left alone with ourselves.  On the contrary, it penetrates into
3171: that darkness and that nothingness, realizing that the mercy of God
3172: has transformed our nothingness into His temple and believing that in
3173: our darkness His light has hidden itself. Hence the sacred attitude
3174: is one which does not recoil from our own inner emptiness, but rather
3175: penetrates it with awe and reverence, and with the awareness of
3176: mystery. This is a most important discovery in, the interior life.”
3177:  Is the use of the word 'God' enough to somehow make any sort of
3178: distinction between Heidegger's 'atheism' (which he explicitly
3179: denies) and Merton's 'theism'?  A Nihilistic language would be one
3180: that attempts to reconcile such superficial disparities. <br>
3181: 	With
3182: that said, Heidegger admits that his full conception of
3183: 'Being-Towards-Death' is one that is 'fantastical'.  That is to say,
3184: if we are to develop past a purely Heideggarian analysis of Being,
3185: how does one, in fact, proceed in a constant participation with an
3186: existence that is drowned in the meaninglessness of the world and
3187: which faces annihilation at any moment?  Is it possible to even
3188: proceed with, or in, such a 'fantastical' structure?  Further, what
3189: is to be meant by a 'True-Self' as interpreted on not 'wholly
3190: naturalistic' terms which avoids, in its analysis of the human
3191: condition, from falling back into the language of myth and worldly
3192: 'religion'?  On the other hand, is there any kind of 'positive'
3193: substance that stems from the Nihilistic experience which is not to
3194: be interpreted as wholly biological, naturalistic, and worldly, as
3195: many interpreters of Heidegger have done so far with his language? 
3196: Heidegger himself dismisses both 'biological' explanations and,
3197: seemingly traditional conceptions of, 'God' as too preemptive as they
3198: are hindered by assumptions that do not necessarily leave open the
3199: mystery of the 'Why?'. <br>
3200: <br>
3201: 	"The onotological analysis
3202: of conscience on which we are thus embarking, is prior to any
3203: description and classification of Experiences of conscience, and
3204: likewise lies outsuide any biological 'explination' of this
3205: phenomenon.  But it is also no less distant from a theological
3206: exigesis of conscience or any employment of this phenomenon for
3207: proofs of God or  for establishing an 'immediate' conscience of God."
3208:  (pg. 313)<br>
3209: <br>
3210: 	('The Call' as both from oneself and beyond
3211: oneself)  "If the interpretation continues in this direction,
3212: one supplies a possesor for the power thus posited, or one takes the
3213: power itself as a person who makes himself known- namely God.  On the
3214: other hand one may try to reject this explination in which the caller
3215: is taken as an alien manifestation of such a power, and to explain
3216: away the conscience 'biologically' at the same time.  Both these
3217: sexplinations pass over the phenomenal findings too hastly."
3218: (pg. 320)<br>
3219: <br>
3220: 	This new language must not be seen as
3221: 'rescuing' one from the Nothingness, rather it is a language that
3222: attempts to bring one 'face to face' with the nightmare of existence.
3223:  The terror of existence is one that opens up the 'positive' content.
3224:  The unending questioning of 'why?' opens up something that is not
3225: wholly natural, yet must still be experienced and discussed within
3226: the world.  Even the mystical experience, while a blow to Naturalism,
3227: does not defeat Naturalism.  One of the few accurate statements that
3228: Sartre put forth when describing his particular brand of 
3229: 'existentialism' was that whether God exists or not, it's all still
3230: the same, it makes no difference (regardless</div>
3231: <div> if
3232: he was using this statement as a 'defense' of his atheistic
3233: existentialism).  The ultimately empty structure of Naturalism must
3234: be experienced as a ladder into Transcendence, not as an obstacle to
3235: be overcome.  One must not play with the toys of the world that are
3236: crushed into dust with every movement. To keep grabbing at new,
3237: vanishing toys is but a distraction of unthinking robots that is not
3238: grounded in Nihilism.<br>
3239: 	When one holds to any form of optimism as
3240: they speak of the Other, one knows that this person has not been
3241: grasped by the Nothing of the world.  While we are all damned to some
3242: particular idolatry, optimism is one of its lowest forms.  The
3243: fanaticism of thought that brews in the fear of Nihilism is only a
3244: turning away from Nihilism, an illusion of comfort; there is no
3245: embracing, there is no participation in the Nothingness.  The worldly
3246: religions are fundamentally fanatical in nature due to their turning
3247: away of Nihilism.  Spong, in his desire to 'revive' the dying
3248: language of Christianity, says: “We fear that if theism is
3249: dismissed, only a bottomless pit remains.” and “Many forms of
3250: religion are little more than cultural manifestations of the fear of
3251: nothingness.  That is why people become hysterical when theism is
3252: challenged.”  <br>
3253: 	 One last mention on the falsity of 'optimism'
3254: is deserving, if only because it is the overwhelming strain of
3255: thought within the current American culture; this 'optimism' shows
3256: itself in forms of 'prosperity churches' all the way to some type of
3257: foundationless 'humanism'.  Quoting St. Seraphim Rose once more will
3258: thus prove to be deserving: “And indeed the Christian is, in a
3259: certain sense--in an ultimate sense--a "Nihilist"; for to
3260: him, in the end, the world is nothing, and God is all. This is, of
3261: course, the precise opposite of the Nihilism we have examined here,
3262: where God is nothing and the world is all; that is a Nihilism that
3263: proceeds from the Abyss, and the Christian's is a "Nihilism"
3264: that proceeds from abundance. The true Nihilist places his faith in
3265: things that pass away and end in nothing; all "optimism" on
3266: this foundation is clearly futile.”<br>
3267: 	A relevant example of
3268: this sort of 'unthinking', or lack of search for Transcendence, can
3269: be shown within the mindset of a majority of practicing scientists of
3270: today.  Science, assuming a 'realist' perspective, as describing
3271: 'reality' with physical laws, allows one to predict and 'know' what
3272: is or will happen within the world.  However, to stop at this formal
3273: description of reality is unphilosophical.  The Philosopher wants to
3274: ask why the descriptions of science are the way they are.  It is
3275: 'understood' that 'particles' and 'molecules' bump into one another
3276: in a particular pattern which produce the physical objects that we
3277: see around us and even ourselves.  To comprehend a description of
3278: things is not to comprehend why, seemingly mindless particles and
3279: molecules are acting in the ways in which they do.  Why are there
3280: 'things', why are these 'things' following a particular rational
3281: structure, and why is a there a 'building' process found within these
3282: 'things'?  These philosophical questions are shunned by a majority of
3283: mainstream scientific 'intellectuals'.  This sort of 'unthinking' is
3284: what has produced the 'optimistic' scientism of the current times. 
3285: <br>
3286: 	There is a similar criticism of 'unthinking' to be made
3287: against traditional 'religious' interpretations of the human
3288: condition.  Many religious interpretations of the human experience
3289: are replete with theological assumptions that are not necessarily
3290: grounded in human experience; these take the forms of rituals,
3291: prayers, moral declarations, metaphysical claims, and so on. 
3292: However, a language that prepares 'answers' or 'rational defenses'
3293: rather than opening up the mystery of the ground of all things must
3294: be labeled as a lower form of idolatry.  These assumptions, as with
3295: many religious languages, are the reason why Heidegger proclaimed
3296: that a 'Christian philosophy' was the equivalent of a 'round-square'.
3297:  Heidegger's thought is that the religious languages that have so far
3298: been developed are restrictive of the human experience of the Other. 
3299: In other words, religions with their theologies contain too many
3300: assumptions and 'answers' that shun the mystery of existence. 
3301: Philosophy, on the other hand, the relentless 'Why?', is what is
3302: needed in order to open up the mystery of Being, instead of closing
3303: it off and pushing it into a closet.  One cannot turn the Other into
3304: the worldly, whether that attempt is through reason or myth.  These
3305: are simple, lower forms of idolatry. <br>
3306: <br>
3307: <br>
3308: “In
3309: particular, that in the face of which one has anxiety is not
3310: encountered as something definite with which one can concern oneself;
3311: the threatening does not come from what is ready-to-hand or
3312: present-at-hand, but rather from the fact that neither of these
3313: ‘says’ anything any longer. Environmental entities no longer have
3314: any involvement. The world in which I exist has sunk into
3315: insignificance; and the world which is thus disclosed is one in which
3316: entities can be freed only in the character of having no involvement.
3317: Anxiety is anxious in the face of the “nothing” of the world; but
3318: this does not mean that in anxiety we experience something like the
3319: absence of what is present-at-hand within-the-world. The
3320: present-at-hand must be encountered in just such a way that it does
3321: not have any involvement whatsoever, but can show itself in an empty
3322: mercilessness.”  68b<br>
3323: <br>
3324: “Anxiety discloses the
3325: insignificance of the world; and this insignificance reveals the
3326: nullity of that with which one can concern oneself—or, in other
3327: words, the impossibility of projecting oneself upon a
3328: potentiality-for-Being which belongs to existence and which is
3329: founded primarily upon one’s objects of concern.”<br>
3330: <br>
3331: “That
3332: in the face of which one is anxious is completely indefinite. Not
3333: only does this indefiniteness leave factically undecided which entity
3334: within-the-world is threatening us, but it also tells us that
3335: entities within-the-world are not ‘relevant’ at all.”<br>
3336: <br>
3337: “The
3338: utter insignificance which makes itself known in the 'nothing and
3339: nowhere', does not signify that the world is absent, but tells us
3340: that entities within-the-world are of so little importance in
3341: themselves that on the basis of this insignificance of what is
3342: within-the-world, the world in its worldhood is all that still
3343: obtrudes itself.”<br>
3344: <br>
3345: “The question is there in a spell of
3346: boredom, when we are equally distant from despair and joy, but when
3347: the stubborn ordinariness of beings lays open a wasteland in which it
3348: makes no difference to us whether beings are or are not—and then,
3349: in a distinctive form, the question resonates once again: Why are
3350: there beings at all instead of nothing?”<br>
3351: <br>
3352: “In dread,
3353: being as a whole becomes untenable.” <br>
3354: <br>
3355: “That existence
3356: is pervaded by nihilating behavior attests to the permanent and
3357: indeed obscured manifestness of no-thing that dread originally
3358: discloses. But this means original dread is suppressed for the most
3359: part in existence. Dread is there. It's only napping. Its breath
3360: permanently trembles in existence, only slightly in the apprehensive,
3361: and inaudibly in the "Uh húh!" and "Húh uh!" of
3362: those who are busy; best of all in the reserved, surest of all at the
3363: heart of existence that is daring. But this happens only in those for
3364: whom it expends itself in order to preserve the ultimate greatness of
3365: existence.”<br>
3366: <br>
3367: “The beholdenness of existence to no-thing
3368: on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole,
3369: transcendence.”<br>
3370: <br>
3371: “As surely as we never get a sure
3372: grasp of the generality of be-ing in itself, just assurely do we all
3373: the same find ourselves somehow placed in the midst of the generality
3374: of bare be-ing. In the end, there continues to be [besteht]an
3375: essential difference between getting a grasp of the whole of be-ing
3376: in itself and finding oneself in the midst of be-ing as a whole.  The
3377: former is impossible in principle. The latter happens all the time in
3378: our existence. Of course, it looks just as though in our everyday
3379: comings and goings we were holding fast to only just this or that
3380: [kind of] be-ing, as though we were lost in this or that realm of
3381: be-ing. But no matter how fragmented the daily round may seem, it
3382: always maintains be-ing in the unity of a "whole," although
3383: only in the shadows.  Even then and precisely just then, when we are
3384: not especially busy with things, this "as a whole"
3385: overcomes us; for example, in genuine boredom.  This is a long way
3386: off far off when this or that book or play, job or leisure activity,
3387: is boring. It breaks out when "it's boring." Profound
3388: boredom, like a silent fog insinuating itself in the depths of
3389: existence, pulls things, others and oneself into it altogether with
3390: remarkable indifference. Such boredom reveals be-ing as a whole.”<hr><h1><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=Nihiltheism" data-non-editable="true" spellcheck="false" data-upnote-tag="#Nihiltheism" title="#Nihiltheism">#Nihiltheism</a><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=direxperience" data-non-editable="true" spellcheck="false" data-upnote-tag="#direxperience" title="#direxperience">#direxperience</a><a href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=naturalism" data-non-editable="true" spellcheck="false" data-upnote-tag="#naturalism" title="#naturalism">#naturalism</a>&nbsp;<a title="#suicide" data-upnote-tag="#suicide" spellcheck="false" data-non-editable="true" href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=suicide">#suicide</a><a title="#mystical" data-upnote-tag="#mystical" spellcheck="false" data-non-editable="true" href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=mystical">#mystical</a>&nbsp;<a title="#langauge" data-upnote-tag="#langauge" spellcheck="false" data-non-editable="true" href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=langauge">#langauge</a></h1><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=3c666833-fa47-4278-bb80-e2618e1524eb">The Religious Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=9caf4e79-64fc-4ec6-8b57-e3f67ebb4f0f">-Nihilism Preface-</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=31c33632-c558-4a6f-99e1-a5c3992d70c5">The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=4424cfcd-68fd-40a4-a127-13835f2d6384">The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=397b60f2-0c4b-4825-bdb2-ca81b3eff7e9">Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=fc9e2d1d-fdcb-4bd5-ba73-4286c1716bb3">The Startling Encounter with Infinite Nothingness</a></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=aaae8c71-8355-4c08-ac6b-104854227cb0">The Symbolic Resonance of Nothing</a></div><div><br></div><div><a data-non-editable="true" data-note-id="e522d18f-dd1c-47ca-ad66-78f9ba9a4b43" href="upnote://x-callback-url/openNote?noteId=e522d18f-dd1c-47ca-ad66-78f9ba9a4b43">The Religious Experience of Nihilism</a></div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div></div></div></body>

Dear Professor Craig
</div><div>
My name is Adam. I am an atheist, and have been one ever since I can remember. I was brought up in the Roman Catholic church, but could never really say that I held any theistic beliefs with any sincerity. For instance, one time, when I was around eight or nine years old, I asked a nun at my church where I "was" before I was born. She responded: "You were with God." I was still curious, so I asked her how long I was with God, before my being born, and she proclaimed: "For an eternity!" I then asked her why I could not remember "existing with God” for an eternity of time (is an eternity of time even a coherent concept?). She had enough with that question and proceeded to shew me away to play with the other children. Looking back, I am proud of my skeptical disposition.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's skip ahead a little bit. I found philosophy and I fell in love with it. I transferred schools in order to obtain my BA. Almost all of the papers I wrote as an undergrad were about atheism or God. I was on a mission to be as rational as I could with regards to my atheistic beliefs. Moreover, I was practically an "evangelical" atheist, proclaiming the good word of rationality! My beliefs were strident at best, and intolerant at worst. I thought I had the "God question" all figured out. It was a settled issue for me: God did not exist. The philosophy of religion was my initial and main draw to philosophy, but I soon found myself wanting to explore philosophy in all its glory. Philosophy, as a whole, was too interesting to just "stop", then move on to some "real job". I decided to apply to an MA program in philosophy at CSULA, and got accepted. Philosophy was something that I took very seriously. So much so, that I drove from NY to CA with no job and no place to live in order to continue my studies. I actually wrote a response to your paper&nbsp;<em>The Absurdity of Life Without God</em>&nbsp;and used it as my writing sample in order to get in to CSULA. I stayed up for months writing and polishing my responses to your claims of the inconsistency of atheism in its response to meaning, value, and purpose in life. I had too. You were telling me my life, as a&nbsp;<em>direct</em>&nbsp;result of my worldview, was worthless in every possible way. Well, as an ambitious philosophy student, I could not simply let you get away this. Your objections to atheism needed answers. And after wrestling with your paper for some time, I actually felt pretty good about the end product and presumed to have "answered" your objections to atheism in a satisfactory way. I could now move on, live my life with the excitement, consistency, and appreciation that I had before reading your essay.</div><div><br></div><div>I was wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>I should have known better too, since the first time I read that paper of yours, I couldn't sleep for two days. It completely shattered my worldview. Let me mention here that I was a huge fan of the New Atheists, but I always sensed something was askew with them. Something seemed off about them because whenever they were talking about meaning, value, or purpose, they answered in such ways that only a person ignorant of the objections in your paper could respond. In short (too late), your paper never left my mind, even years after I wrote a "response" to it. I knew, deep down, that not only did I not, but could not answer your objections to atheism. What you say the atheistic worldview entails is true. There is no escaping the nihilism as an atheist.</div><div><br></div><div>Everything has died for me.</div><div><br></div><div>You have ruined my life.</div><div><br></div><div>Before I go any further, let me say that you are and always have been my favorite living philosopher. I have seen every debate you have ever recorded and put up on the internet. I watch all your lectures and talks (Closer to Truth, youtube, etc.) I think you are the epitome of what a philosopher should be. You're uber logical, fantastically clear, and "computeresk" with the speed and precision of your responses to objections against your position, particularly the criticisms you respond to in your debates. For a long time now, I have wanted to be a philosopher as you are a philosopher. I want to have an argument posed against my position, and be able to dissect it in the same manner as you do. I can honestly say that I have learned more from reading what you have wrote and watching you on the internet than maybe all of my years in school, formally studying philosophy. I seem to owe you a lot, with regards to my philosophical development, at least.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, let's get down to business and why exactly it is that you have ruined my life. After reading your paper on the absurdity of life without God, I soon realized that I&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;to become a nihilist. To act otherwise would inevitably reduce into an inconsistency. Nihilism is the logical conclusion of an atheistic worldview. Yet, nihilism is unlivable. Christopher Hitchens used to say that you cannot derive any knowledge of what an atheist believes from the fact that she is an atheist. If someone claims to be an atheist, according to Hitchens, you can only conclude that she believes that "God does not exist" or that she "lacks a belief in God" (don't get me started with that distinction!!!) You cannot “go any further” and know if she is a Marxist or a Capitalist, etc. But your paper shows that Hitchens is patently false about this. Atheism necessarily entails nihilistic conclusions about certain questions, particularly those you bring up in your paper about meaning, value, and purpose.</div><div><br></div><div>There is a similar misunderstanding that shows how atheists fail to fully comprehend the severity of their own worldview. I feel like I need to say how disappointed I am in the New Atheists, and moreover, the professional philosophers, who do not understand the "moral argument" for God's existence. Why can't they comprehend the ontology of values? Why is this so difficult? It is all too obvious that you are not talking about whether people can act, or know of the, "good" on atheism, but rather that there is no foundation for morality outside of God. Sorry, I just had to rant a little, because it bothers me when philosophers, who should know better, don't comprehend the moral argument. I can only imagine how frustrated you must feel. Further, I hate all the nasty comments you get on YouTube. People don't even understand how well thought out your views are. You have the most coherent worldview I have ever heard anyone describe. Sorry, just wanted to say that you have at least one atheist on your side, sir.</div><div>So, this brings me to the problem (finally, sorry)-</div><div><br></div><div>Philosophically, I agree with almost everything you say. Not in a “follower” sense, but in that I find what you say either convincingly true or I find I come to the same conclusions that you do with regards to particular ideas that I have reasoned through on my own. With that said, I am still an atheist. How is this possible? How could my favorite philosopher be a Christian, I agree with almost everything he says, yet I am an atheist? Well, it seems that you make an extremely strong case for the rationality of an “abstract” notion of God, but I cannot get myself to go the extra step further and believe any of the world religions (not that I believe this abstract God actually exists either, it just seems to be becoming more and more plausible to me). I definitely cannot get myself to be a Christian. Christianity just does not seem true to me. However, the deeper I dive into philosophy, the more the theistic worldview seems more plausible. The concepts or “language” of mathematics seems to “cry out” as you put it for an explanation, objective moral values seem to be real (but they can't be “real”, if atheism is true), the idea of "existence" nauseates me to no end (just the thought of anything, at all, existing, and especially existing without any reason, frightens me,), and I could go on and on. You know, all the things you speak about in your YouTube videos.</div><div><br></div><div>However, even when I don't think about the arguments, and I think about what you and others have said about the “Holy Spirit”, I cannot get myself to believe that this “Holy Spirit” exists and can authenticate my belief in God. As you know, Martin Luther thought the Holy Spirit would guide people in reading the Bible properly, when the Reformation was underway, since there was the concern that without the guidance of the church, people may interpret the bible incorrectly. The Holy Spirit's guiding capabilities seem to be have been proven empirically false though, due to such a wide variety of conflicting beliefs all being derived from the Bible. Now I know that the diversity of beliefs doesn't necessarily allow for the conclusion that all of the religious beliefs or experiences are false, that there aren't at least some beliefs or experiences that are true, and therefore the Holy Spirit does not exist. However, this disagreement does cause pause in me, and it makes the situation suspect enough to where I cannot seemingly distinguish between an authentic experience with the Holy Spirit or my being deluded. There does not seem to be anything here to help me out of the nihilistic rut. Lately though, I have been questioning why I even value “rationality”, or what it even means to “value” rationality on an atheistic worldview. That's another topic though, sorry.</div><div><br></div><div>Let me wrap this ramble up. I am now stuck in a nihilistic-atheistic world that I hate. Agnosticism is not even a coherent position to me, with regards to a Perfect Being, since I believe that the greatest conceivable being could give me knowledge of its existence, if it wanted to. Theism is a dream come true. The world would make sense, the existential mysteries that haunt me would be solved, life would be livable. It is atheism, however, which seems to be true, yet I do not want to live like this. I have become depressed to no end. I have been in a nihilistic rut for years now. I have become utterly recluse. Yet, even with all this, I cannot come to believe in God. What would YOU suggest I do? This letter is as sincere as it gets. You may be my last hope. Since I agree with you on so much, I was hoping you would have the answer to this. I know the “answer”&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Christianity, but as I said, I cannot get myself to believe its truth.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I am an atheist who hates atheism. I want there to be a God more than anything, yet I cannot get myself to believe in one. I cannot seem to give an adequate answer to Camus's question: “Is life worth living?”</div><div>A feel like a philosopher of your caliber is the only person I have left to turn to. A psychologist wouldn't get my concerns, at least I don't think think they would. I need the clarity and reasonableness of a philosopher. Please, help.</div><div>Your biggest atheist fan,</div><div>Adam</div><div><br></div><div>PS- Do me one favor? Even if you never have time to respond. Please, do not debate Lawrence Krauss anymore. As with most people not trained in philosophy, it is not even an argument in any sort of philosophical sense. He is a shouting bag of hot air with irrelevant criticisms and gross misunderstandings of the arguments. He does not deserve to be the face for atheism, we both know this. But maybe this is your plan.&nbsp;

CRAIG’S RESPONSE</h2><hr>Adam,&nbsp;</div><div>it is so encouraging to get a letter like yours! You have seen through the fog of often hateful rhetoric to discern the real issues. Your story reminds me so much of C. S. Lewis, who, as a scientific naturalist, found everything that he thought was real to be meaningless and unfulfilling, and everything he loved, such as myth, legend, and fantasy, to be imaginary and unreal. Like you, Lewis approached Christ gradually, shedding first his naturalism and then later his scepticism about Jesus of Nazareth. Lewis finally broke the bonds of the naturalism that had bound him, discovering in Christ the “true myth,” the fusion of rationality and imagination. Once you free yourself of your atheism, you’ll find the next step to Christian theism a relatively short one.<div><br></div><div>You mention your scepticism about Luther’s belief that the Holy Spirit “<em>would guide people in reading the Bible properly</em>,” for “<em>The Holy Spirit's guiding capabilities seem to be have been proven empirically false. . . , due to such a wide variety of conflicting beliefs all being derived from the Bible.</em>” Now I don’t subscribe to the belief you attribute to Luther; nevertheless, the argument you offer against it does not strike me as a good one. In order to prevent a plethora of divergent interpretations, what would be required is, not just that Holy Spirit would guide people into the truth, but that Holy Spirit would intervene to prevent aberrant interpretations of the Bible as well, and Luther never claimed that He does that. If Luther is right, one would expect to find people adhering to a correct interpretation and others departing from the true way and propounding deviant interpretations, which is exactly what we do find. Luther’s view would be falsified only if everyone departed from the truth.</div><div><br></div><div>I think that what the Holy Spirit does is to furnish believers with a fundamental assurance of their being properly related to God and unbelievers a conviction of their not being properly related to God but of being in need of His forgiveness and moral cleansing. While this entails the truth of certain core Christian claims, it does not guarantee proper interpretation of biblical passages. That is instead achieved through the use of proper hermeneutical techniques of literary interpretation.</div><div><br></div><div>I think you already discern the weakness of your objection, for you say, “<em>I know that the diversity of beliefs doesn't necessarily allow for the conclusion that all of the religious beliefs or experiences are false, that there aren't at least some beliefs or experiences that are true, and therefore the Holy Spirit does not exist.</em>” Right; you need to be open to the convicting witness of the Spirit in your life that you need God’s forgiveness and cleansing for your moral failures. Anyone who thinks hard about the moral argument should realize that if objective moral values and duties do exist, he falls desperately short of the moral good and so fails to discharge his moral duties and is thus in need of forgiveness and redemption. Indeed, I think probably no one comes to faith in Christ apart from a conviction of his guilt and need of moral renovation.</div><div><br></div><div>You have good things to say about the theistic arguments I’ve defended; but you do not mention my equally rigorous work, flowing out of my doctoral studies under Wolfhart Pannenberg at the University of Munich, on the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection. I was astonished to discover as a result of my study that the main facts undergirding the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection are actually agreed upon by the majority of historical Jesus scholars today, not just conservative scholars but the broad mainstream of New Testament scholars, including a good number of Jewish scholars, who teach at secular universities and non-evangelical divinity schools. So I think faith in Jesus is historically quite well-founded.</div><div><br></div><div>So now we come to the million dollar question: “<em>What would YOU suggest I do?</em>” I take this question very seriously. So here’s what I suggest you do:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><ul><li> Read C. S. Lewis’ book&nbsp;<em>Surprised by Joy</em>. I think you will resonate with Lewis’ struggle, both to free himself of atheism and then of his scepticism about Christian faith.</li><li>&nbsp;Seek experiences that put you in touch with the transcendent. You need to escape the cloying bonds of naturalism by catching glimpses of a transcendent reality beyond the material world. This will help to prepare your heart for belief in God. So open yourself to experiences of sublime beauty. Listen to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHlfNYY1YIY">Schumann’s&nbsp;<em>Träumerei</em></a>, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETNoPqYAIPI">Dvorak’s&nbsp;<em>New World Symphony</em></a>, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_pkRH2DZuw">Rimsky-Korsakov’s&nbsp;<em>Scheherazade</em></a>, and so on. And when I say “listen,” I don’t mean to have it playing in the background while you go about your tasks. I mean to set all else aside for an allotted time, close your eyes, and just focus on listening to the music. Watch a video of ballroom champions Jonathan Crossley and Lyn Marriner performing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbLHVJpCaUo">waltz</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnOHtMJSBjQ">slow foxtrot</a>. Drink in the stunning beauty of their performance. Watch a sunrise or sunset over a beautiful landscape or take in the beauty of pristine nature. Such beauty can sometimes produce an almost painful ache in us because of our inability to take it all in.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Read the Gospels about the life of Jesus. If you haven’t already done so, you’ll find the story of his life gripping. Jesus is a tremendously attractive person in the wisdom of his teaching, in his character, and in the authenticity of his life.<br></li></ul><ul><li>&nbsp;Look into the historical credibility of the personal claims and resurrection of Jesus. Read,&nbsp;<em>e.g</em>., the relevant chapters in&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.biola.edu/apologetics-store/products/books/item/reasonable-faith-christian-truth-and-apologetics-3rd-edition_Book"><em>Reasonable Faith</em></a>&nbsp;(Crossway, 2008). Read my debates with sceptical New Testament critics like John Dominic Crossan (<a href="https://apps.biola.edu/apologetics-store/products/books/item/will-the-real-jesus-please-stand-up_Book"><em>Will the Real Jesus Please Stand Up?,</em></a>&nbsp;ed. Paul Copan [Baker, 1998] or Gerd Lüdemann (<a href="https://apps.biola.edu/apologetics-store/products/books/item/jesus-resurrection-fact-or-figment_Book"><em>The Resurrection: Fact or Figment?</em></a>&nbsp;ed. Paul Copan [Inter-Varsity, 2000] and ask which way the evidence points.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Embark on a spiritual experiment. Begin to pray daily. Attend a church where the Gospel is faithfully preached and you can be with Christians to get to know them. You’ll find these people to be unlike ordinary people you meet, more reflective, more compassionate, more focused on spiritual things.<br></li></ul><ul><li>&nbsp;Finally, get a copy of Francis Thompson’s poem&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/HUMANITY/HNDHVN.HTM">“The Hound of Heaven.”</a>&nbsp;The person it describes is you, Adam! “With unhurrying chase, and unperturbèd pace, deliberate speed, majestic instancy,” He is after you and will continue His pursuit until you recognize in Him all that you are longing for.<br></li></ul></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>- William Lane Craig</strong></div></div><br><div><a title="#Nihiltheism" data-upnote-tag="#Nihiltheism" spellcheck="false" data-non-editable="true" href="upnote://x-callback-url/tag/view?tag=Nihiltheism">#Nihiltheism</a></div></div></div></div></body>
