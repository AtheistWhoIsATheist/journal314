odness there is no hint. Such also is the attitude of those who, in our own day, base their morality upon the struggle for survival, maintaining that the survivors are necessarily the fittest. But others, not content with an answer so repugnant to the moral sense, will adopt the position which we have become accustomed to regard as specially religious, maintaining that, in some hidden manner, the world of fact is really harmonious with the world of ideals. Thus Man creates God, all-powerful and all-good, the mystic unity of what is and what should be.”

- “Let us admit that, in the world we know there are many things that would be better otherwise, and that the ideals to which we do and must adhere are not realized in the realm of matter.”
- “Let us preserve our respect for truth, for beauty, for the ideal of perfection which life does not permit us to attain, though none of these things meet with the approval of the unconscious universe. If Power is bad, as it seems to be, let us reject it from our hearts. In this lies Man’s true freedom: in determination to worship only the God created by our own love of the good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the insight of our best moments. In action, in desire, we must submit perpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in aspiration, we are free, free from our fellowmen, free from the petty planet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live, from the tyranny of death. Let us learn, then, that energy of faith which enables us to live constantly in the vision of the good; and let us descend, in action, into the world of fact, with that vision always before us.”
- “Freedom comes only to those who no longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal goods that are subject to the mutations of Time.”
- “Yet, by death, by illness, by poverty, or by the voice of duty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made for us, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave for, Fate may nevertheless forbid them.”
- “Except for those rare spirits that are born without sin, there is a cavern of darkness to be traversed before that temple can be entered. The gate of the cavern is despair, and its floor is paved with the gravestones of abandoned hopes. There Self must die; there the eagerness, the greed of untamed desire must be slain, for only so can the soul be freed from the empire of Fate. But out of the cavern the Gate of Renunciation leads again to the daylight of wisdom, by whose radiance a new insight, a new joy, a new tenderness, shine forth to gladden the pilgrim’s heart.”
- “In the spectacle of Death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and in the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an overpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, the depth, the inexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange marriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of sorrow. In these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of temporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care for the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the common life of day by day; we see, surrounding the narrow raft illumined by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour; from the great night without, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge; all the loneliness of humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual soul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command, against the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its hopes and fears.”
- “To take into the inmost shrine of the soul the irresistible forces whose puppets we seem to be—Death and change, the irrevocableness of the past, and the powerlessness of man before the blind hurry of the universe from vanity to vanity—to feel these things and know them is to conquer them.”
- “To abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things—this is emancipation, and this is the free man’s worship. And this liberation is effected by a contemplation of Fate; for Fate itself is subdued by the mind which leaves nothing to be purged by the purifying fire of Time.”
- “Brief and powerless is Man’s life; on him and all his race the slow, sure doom falls pitiless and dark. Blind to good and evil, reckless of destruction, omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless way; for Man, condemned to-day to lose his dearest, to-morrow himself to pass through the gate of darkness...”
-“Such, in outline, but even more purposeless, more void of meaning, is the world which Science presents for our belief. Amid such a world, if anywhere, our ideals henceforward must find a home. That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all
the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built.”

Mysticism and Logic

- “...most of them were less anxious to understand the world of science and daily life than to convict it of unreality in the interests of a super-sensible "real" world. It is in this way that logic has been pursued by those of the great philosophers who were mystics. But since they usually took for granted the supposed insight of the mystic emotion, their logical doctrines were presented with a certain dryness, and were believed by their disciples to be quite independent of the sudden illumination from which they sprang.”  (Symbolism, the direct experience drove them to these conclusions/the 'unreality' of the world does not conflict with science since 'most' mystically inclined thinkers take 'illusion' to be the world's transitory nature rather than as 'not really existing', therefore science still stands as a description or model of the transitory world)
- “It is difficult to give a logically tenable account of this position without recognizing that good and evil are subjective, that what is good is merely that towards which we have one kind of feeling, and what is evil is merely that towards which we have another kind of feeling. In our active life, where we have to exercise choice, and to prefer this to that of two possible acts, it is necessary to have a distinction of good and evil, or at least of better and worse. But this distinction, like everything pertaining to action, belongs to what mysticism regards as the world of illusion, if only because it is essentially concerned with time.”
- “We are thus brought back to our seeming paradox, that a philosophy which does not seek to impose upon the world its own conceptions of good and evil is not only more likely to achieve truth, but is also the outcome of a higher ethical standpoint than one which, like evolutionism and most traditional systems, is perpetually appraising the universe and seeking to find in it an embodiment of present ideals. In religion, and in every deeply serious view of the world and of human destiny, there is an element of submission, a realisation of the limits of human power, which is somewhat lacking in the modern world, with its quick material successes and its insolent belief in the boundless possibilities of progress. "He that loveth his life shall lose it"; and there is danger lest, through a too confident love of life, life itself should lose much of what gives it its highest worth. The submission which religion inculcates in action is essentially the same in spirit as that which science teaches in thought; and the ethical neutrality by which its victories have been achieved is the outcome of that submission.” (renunciation)
- “In Plato, the same twofold impulse exists, though the mystic impulse is distinctly the stronger of the two, and secures ultimate victory whenever the conflict is sharp. His description of the cave is the classical statement of belief in a knowledge and reality truer and more real than that of the senses...”
- “...the greatest men who have been philosophers have felt the need both of science and of mysticism: the attempt to harmonise the two was what made their life, and what always must, for all its arduous uncertainty, make philosophy, to some minds, a greater thing than either science or religion.”
- “After Socrates has explained that there is an idea of the good, but not of such things as hair and mud and dirt, Parmenides advises him "not to despise even the meanest things," and this advice shows the genuine scientific temper.” (except this is not the temper of most scientists today; this is originally the temper of the saint.  The scientist would just be following in the saints footsteps)
- “Reality, he says, is uncreated, indestructible, unchanging, indivisible; it is "immovable in the bonds of mighty chains, without beginning and without end; since coming into being and passing away have been driven afar, and true belief has cast them away."
- “This is the negative side of the mystic's initiation: the doubt concerning common knowledge, preparing the way for the reception of what seems a higher wisdom.”
- “I believe, however, that the elimination of ethical considerations from philosophy is both scientifically necessary and—though this may seem a paradox—an ethical advance. Both these contentions must be briefly defended. The hope of satisfaction to our more human desires—the hope of demonstrating that the world has this or that desirable ethical characteristic—is not one which, so far as I can see, a scientific philosophy can do anything whatever to satisfy. The difference between a good world and a bad one is a difference in the particular characteristics of the particular things that exist in these worlds: it is not a sufficiently abstract difference to come within the province of philosophy.”
- “A truly scientific philosophy will be more humble, more piecemeal, more arduous, offering less glitter of outward mirage to flatter fallacious hopes, but more indifferent to fate, and more capable of accepting the world without the tyrannous imposition of our human and temporary demands.”

1. Albert Camus

- “A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it.”
-”It happens that the stage sets collapse. Rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday according to the same rhythm—this path is easily followed most of the time. But one day the "why" arises and everything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement. "Begins"—this is important. Weariness comes at the end of the acts of a mechanical life, but at the same time it inaugurates the impulse of consciousness. It awakens consciousness and provokes what follows.  What follows is the gradual return into the chain or it is the definitive awakening. At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: suicide or recovery. In itself weariness has something sickening about it.  Here, I must conclude that it is good.”
- “Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty.  Thus he asserts his youth.
But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.”
- “Men, too, secrete the inhuman. At certain moments of lucidity, the mechanical aspect of their
gestures, their meaningless pantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them. A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his
incomprehensible dumb show: you wonder why he is alive.”
- “We must despair of ever reconstructing the familiar, calm surface which would give us peace of heart.  After so many centuries of inquiries, so many abdications among thinkers, we are well aware that this is true for all our knowledge.”
- “Let us pause here. If I hold to be true that absurdity that determines my relationship with life, if I become thoroughly imbued with that sentiment that seizes me in face of the world's
scenes, with that lucidity imposed on me by the pursuit of a science, I must sacrifice everything to these certainties and I must see them squarely to be able to maintain them.  Above all, I must adapt my behavior to them and pursue them in all their consequences. I am speaking here of decency. But I want to know beforehand if thought can live in those deserts.”
- “Does not the failure reveal, beyond any possible explanation and interpretation, not the absence but the existence of transcendence?" That existence which, suddenly and through a blind act of human confidence, explains everything, he defines as "the unthinkable unity of the
general and the particular." Thus the absurd becomes god (in the broadest meaning of this
word) and that inability to understand becomes the existence that illuminates everything. Nothing logically prepares this reasoning. I can call it a leap.”
- “For him (Kierkegaard), too, antinomy and paradox become criteria of the religious. Thus, the very thing that led to despair of the meaning and depth of this life now gives it its truth and its clarity.”
- “Nothing more profound, for example, than Kierkegaard's view according to which despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin.  For sin is what alienates from God. The absurd, which
is the metaphysical state of the conscious man, does not lead to God.”
- “Kierkegaard may shout in warning: "If man had no eternal consciousness, if, at the bottom of everything, there were merely a wild, seething force producing everything, both large and trifling, in the storm of dark passions, if the bottomless void that nothing can fill underlay all things, what would life be but despair?"  This cry is not likely to stop the absurd man.
Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable. If in order to elude the anxious question: "What would life be?" one must, like the donkey, feed on the roses of illusion, then the absurd mind, rather than resigning itself to falsehood, prefers to adopt fearlessly Kierkegaard' s
reply: "despair." Everything considered, a determined soul will always manage.” (me- wrong again)
- “Suicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man returns to his essential history.”
- “The absurd man thus catches sight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyond which all is collapse and nothingness.  He can then decide to accept such a universe and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation.”
- “The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less
absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious.”
- “Thus, for Chestov acceptance of the absurd is contemporaneous with the absurd itself.
Being aware of it amounts to accepting it, and the whole logical effort of his thought is to bring it out so that at the same time the tremendous hope it involves may burst forth. Let me repeat that this attitude is legitimate.”
- “...like those of Kafka, Kierkegaard, or Chestov...They embrace the God that consumes them.  It is through humility that hope enters in.  For the absurd of this existence assures them a little more of supernatural reality.  If the course of this life leads to God, there is an outcome after all.”
- “Within the limits of the human conditon, what greater hope than the hope that allows an escape from that condition?  As I see once more, existential thought in this regard (and contrary to current opinion) is steeped in a vast hope.”
- “(Kafka) His work is universal (a really absurd work is not universal) to the extent to which it represents the emotionally moving face of a man fleeing humanity, deriving from his contradictions reasons fro believing, reasons for hoping from his fecund despairs, and calling life his terrifying apprenticeship in death.  It is universal because its inspiration is religious.”

1. Emile Cioran
On the Heights of Despair

- “why can't we stay closed up inside ourselves? why do we chase after expression and form, trying to deliver ourselves of our precious contents or"meanings," desperately attempting to organize what is after all a rebellious and chaotic process? wouldn't it be more creative simply to
surrender to our inner fluidity without any intention of objectifying it, intimately and voluptuously soaking in our own inner turmoil and struggle?  then we would feel with much richer intensity the whole inner growth of spiritual experience all kinds of insights would blend
and flourish in a fertile effervescence. a sensation of actuality and spiritual content would be born, like the rise of a wave or a musical phrase. to be full of one's self, not in the sense of pride, but of enrichment, to be tormented by a sense of inner infinity...” (me- Molinos says this almost exactly)
- “only a few can endure such experiences to the end. there is always a serious danger in repressing something which requires objectification, in locking up explosive energy, because there comes a moment when one can not restrain such overwhelming power. and then the fall is from too much plenitude. there are experiences and obsessions one cannot live with. salvation lies in confessing them.  the terrifying experience of death, when preserved in consciousness, becomes
ruinous. if you talk about death, you save part of yourself. but at the same time, something of your real self dies, because objectified meanings lose the actuality they have in consciousness.”
- “the deepest subjective experiences are also the most universal, because through them one
reaches the original source of life. true interiorization leads to a universality inaccessible to those who remain on the periphery.”
- “the vulgar interpretation of universality calls it a phenomenon of quantitative expansion
rather than a qualitatively rich containment. such an interpretation sees lyricism as a peripheral
and inferior phenomenon, the product of spiritual inconsistency, failing to notice that the lyrical resources of subjectivity show remark able freshness and depth. there are people who become lyrical only at crucial moments in their life; some only in the throes of death, when their
entire past suddenly appears before them and hits them with the force of a waterfall. many become lyrical after some decisively critical experience, when the turmoil of their
inner being reaches paroxysm. thus people who are normally inclined toward objectivity and impersonality, strangers both to themselves and to reality, once they become prisoners of love, experience feelings which actualize all their personal resources. the fact that almost everybody writes poetry when in love proves that the resources of conceptual thinking are too poor to
express their inner infinity; inner lyricism finds adequate objectification only through fluid, irrational material.” (a great description of Tillich's ideas of Religious Symbolism)
- “the experience of suffering is a similar case. you never suspected what lay hidden in yourself and in the world, you were living contentedly at the periphery of things, when suddenly those feelings of suffering which are second only to death itself take hold of you and transport you
into a region of infinite complexity, where your subjectivity tosses about in a maelstrom. to be lyrical from suffering means to achieve that inner purification in which wounds cease to be mere
outer manifestations without deep complications and begin to participate in the essence of your being.”
- “there is no authentic lyricism without a grain of interior madness.  it is significant that the beginnings of all mental psychoses are marked by a lyrical phase during which all the usual barriers and limits disappear, giving way to an inner drunkenness of the most fertile, creative kind.”
- “the lyrical state is a state beyond forms and systems.”
- “how distant everything is!  i don't understand why we must do things in this world, why we
must have friends and aspirations, hopes and dreams. wouldn't it be better to retreat to a faraway corner of the world, where all its noise and complications would be heard no
more? Then we could renounce culture and ambitions; we would lose everything and gain nothing; for what is there to be gained from this world? there are people to whom gain is unimportant, who are hopelessly unhappy and lonely. we are so closed to one another! and yet, were we to be totally open to each other, reading into the depths of our souls, how much of our
destiny would we see? We are so lonely in life that we must ask ourselves if the loneliness of dying is not a symbol of our human existence. can there be any consolation at the last moment?  this willingness to live and die in society is a mark of great deficiency.  it is a thousand times preferable to die somewhere alone and abandoned so that you can die without melodramatic
posturing, unseen by anyone.  i despise people who on their death bed master themselves and
adopt a pose in order to impress. tears do not burn except in solitude. those who ask to be surrounded by friends when they die do so out of fear and inability to live their final moments
alone. they want to for get death at the moment of death. they lack infinite heroism. why don't they lock their door and suffer those maddening sensations with a lucidity and a fear beyond all limits?  we are so isolated from everything! but isn't everything equally inaccessible to us? the deepest and most organic death is death in solitude, when even light becomes a principle of death. in such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death. and you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness.”  (Would Tillich agree with this?)
- “on not wanting to live.  there are experiences which one cannot survive, after which one feels that there is no meaning left in anything. once you have reached the limits of life, having
lived to extremity all that is offered at those dangerous borders, the everyday gesture and the usual aspiration lose their seductive charm.”  (Bach is needed, right Heisman?)
- “the most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness.  you grow inside, you dilate madly until there are no boundaries left, you reach the edge of light, where light is stolen by night, and
from that plenitude as in a savage whirlwind you are thrown straight into nothingness.”
- “at the edge of life everything is an occasion for death...every experience is in this case a leap into nothingness.”
- “did not all the mystics feel that they could not live after their great ecstasies?  what could they expect from this world, those who sense, beyond the normal limits, life, loneliness, despair, death?”
- “the passion for the absurd.  there are no arguments. Can anyone who has reached the limit bother with arguments, causes, effects, moral considerations, and so forth? of course not. for
such a person there are only unmotivated motives for living.  on the heights of despair, the passion for the absurd is the only thing that can still throw a demonic light on chaos.  When all the current reasons- moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on - no longer guide one's life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness? Only by a connection with the absurd, by love of absolute uselessness, loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life.” (sounds like Tillich's concrete religious symbols)
- “i feel i must burst because of all that life offers me and because of the prospect of death.
i feel that i am dying of solitude, of love, of despair, of hatred, of all that this world offers me.
with every experience i expand like a balloon blown up beyond its capacity. the most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness.”
- “i live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing.  the passion for the absurd can grow only in a man who has exhausted everything, yet is still capable of undergoing awesome transfigurations.  for one who has lost everything there is nothing left in life except the passion of the absurd.”
- “what else in life could still move such a person?  what seductions?  some say: self-sacrifice for humanity, the public good, the cult of the beautiful, and so forth. i like only those people who have done away with all that - even for a short time. only they have lived in an absolute
manner. only they have the right to speak about life.”
- “only the sick man is delighted by life and praises it so that he won't collapse.”
- “true solitude is the feeling of being absolutely isolated between the earth and the sky. nothing should detract attention from these phenomena of absolute isolation: a fearfully lucid intuition
will reveal the entire drama of man's finite nature facing the infinite nothingness of the world. solitary walks - extremely fertile and dangerous at the same time, for the inner life - must take place in such a way that nothing will obscure the solitary's meditation on man's isolation
in the world. Solitary walks are propitious to an intense process of interiorization especially in the evening, when none of the usual seductions can steal one's interest. then revelations about the
world spring from the deepest corner of the spirit, from the place where it has detached itself from life, from the wound of life. to achieve spirituality, one must be very lonely. so much death-
in-life and so many inner conflagrations.”
- “I am: therefore the world is meaningless.” (Ha! how many times has this been said out loud?)
- “life is the privilege of mediocre people.  only mediocrities live at life's normal temperature; the
others are consumed at temperatures at which life can not endure, at which they can barely breathe, already one foot beyond life.”
- “i propose the agony method to rid you of all these imperfections.  apply it to every generation and its effects will soon be evident. maybe in this way i too could become useful to mankind!
bring every man to the agony of life's last moments by whip, fire, or injections, and through terrible torture he will undergo the great purification afforded by a vision of death.  then free him and
let him run in a fright until he falls exhausted.  i warrant you that the effect is incomparably greater than any obtained through normal means.  if i could, i would drive the entire world to agony to achieve a radical purification of life; i would set a fire burning insidiously at the roots of life, not to
destroy them but to give them a new and different sap, a new heat. the fire i would set to the world would not bring ruin but cosmic transfiguration. in this way life would adjust to higher temperatures and would cease to be an environment propitious to mediocrity. and maybe in this dream, death
too would cease to be immanent in life.” (take psychedelics correctly, Mckenna)
- “i'm speaking of a precise painful sensation, not a vague and undetermined one. as in a hallucinatory dream, you feel that only your head is left, without foundation and support, without a body.”
- “it is a weariness which consumes and destroys. no effort, no hope, no illusion can satisfy you any longer. shocked witless by your own catastrophe, unable to think or to act, caught in cold and
heavy darkness, solitary as in moments of profound regret, you have reached the negative limit of life, its absolute temperature, where the last illusions about life freeze.”
- “i call agonic only those dramatic moments in the battle between life and death when the presence of death is experienced consciously and painfully. true agony occurs when you pass into nothingness through death, when a feeling of weariness consumes you irrevocably and death
wins. in every true agony there is a triumph of death, even though you may continue to live after those moments of weariness.  there is nothing imaginary in this turmoil.  every agony bears a conclusive stamp. isn't agony similar to an incurable sickness which torments us intermittently (me- Sickness Unto Death)?  agonic moments chart the progress of death in life, revealing a drama in our consciousness caused by the disruption of the balance between life and death.  such moments
are not possible except in that sensation of weariness which brings life down to its absolute negative value.”
- “i want to die but I am sorry that I want to die.  this is the feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness.” (Kierkegaard, Tillich courage to be pg 11)
- “how good it would be if one could die by throwing oneself into an infinite void!”
- “the complexity of the grotesque born out of despair resides in its capacity to indicate an inner infinity and to produce a paroxysm of the highest tension.”
- “it is evident to anyone who understands the multiple forms of inner drama that the grotesque hides secret tragedies, indirectly expressed. whoever has seen his face grotesquely disfigured can never forget it, because he will always be afraid of himself.”
- “one loses one's sense of security and the normal sensation of the immediate and the concrete.”
- “the truly awful thing in madness is that we sense a total and irrevocable loss of life while we are still living.”
- “in death one loses everything, by a fall into nothingness.  that is why the fear of death is persistent and essential, but actually less strange than the fear of madness, in which our semi-presence creates an anxiety more complex than the organic fear of the total nothingness of death. but wouldn't madness be an escape from the misery of life?”
- “i would like instead a shower of warm light to fall from me, transfiguring the entire world, an
unecstatic burst of light preserving the calm of luminous eternity. far from the concentrations of ecstasy, it would be all graceful lightness and smiling warmth. The entire world should float in this dream of light, in this transparent and unreal state of delight.  obstacles and matter, form and limits would cease to exist. then let me die of light in such a landscape.”
- “there are questions which, once approached, either isolate you or kill you outright. afterward you have nothing more to lose. from then on, your erstwhile "serious" pursuits- your spiritual
quest for more varied forms of life, your limitless longing for inaccessible things, your elevated
frustration with the limits of empiricism- all become simple manifestations of an excessively exuberant sensibility, lacking the profound seriousness which characterizes the man who has penetrated the realm of dangerous mysteries.”
- “only the organic and existential thinker is capable of this kind of seriousness, because truth for him is alive, born from inner agony and organic disorder rather than useless speculation. out
of the shadow of the abstract man, who thinks for the pleasure of thinking, emerges the organic man, who thinks because of a vital imbalance, and who is beyond science and art.” (Huxley said this about art, I find philosophy to be 'useless speculation, rather than a concern about the Truth of existence)
- “to step into death does not mean, as commonly believed, especially by christians, to draw one's
last breath and to pass into a region qualitatively different from life. it means, rather, to discover in the course of life the way toward death and to find in life's vital signs the immanent abyss of death.”
- “but why is the experience of agony so rare? Can it be that our hypothesis is entirely false and
that sketching a metaphysics of death is possible only by accepting death's transcendental nature?”
- “from a grave perspective, every step in life is a step into death and memory is only the sign
of nothingness. the average man, deprived of metaphysical understanding, does not have this consciousness of progressive advance into death, though neither he nor anyone else can escape its inexorable destiny.  but when consciousness becomes independent of life, the revelation of death
becomes so strong that its presence destroys all naiveté, all joyful enthusiasm, and all natural voluptuousness. to have the consciousness of death is something perverse and extremely corrupt. the naive poetry of life, its seductions and charms, appear empty of content.  equally empty are man's finalizing projects and his theological illusions.”
- “whoever has not experienced the awful agony of death, rising and spreading like a surge of blood, like the choking grasp of a snake which provokes terrifying hallucinations, does not know the demonic character of life and the state of inner effervescence from which great transfigurations arise.  such a state of black drunkenness is a necessary prerequisite to understanding why one wishes the immediate end of this world.”
- “happy the man who could abandon himself to this becoming and could absorb all the possibilities offered each moment, ignoring the agonizingly problematic evaluation
which discovers in every moment an insurmountable relativity.”
- “the revelation of death's immanence in life occurs during illnesses and long depressive states.
there are, of course, other ways, but they are accidental and individual, and do not have the same potential for revelation as illness or depression.”
- “only those who truly suffer are capable of of genuine content and infinite seriousness...there are many who would gladly give up metaphysical revelations, obtained through despair, agony, and death, in exchange for a naive love or the voluptuous unconsciousness of dance.”
- “these states, in which separation from the world steadily and painfully increases, bring man closer to his inner reality and cause him to discover death in his own subjectivity. a growing interiority progresses toward the essential center of subjectivity, overcoming all the social forms which usually mask it. once beyond this center, progressive interiority discovers the region
where life mingles with death, where man has not yet detached himself from the primary sources of existence, where the demonic rhythm of life works with complete irrationality.  in cases of depression, the awareness of death's immanence in life creates an atmosphere of constant dissatisfaction and restlessness that can never be appeased.”
- “the fear of death, which is nothing but the fear of the nothingness into which death throws us, proves that death presupposes nothingness.”
- “even though belief in eternity is necessary as historical man's unique consolation, the catastrophic ending of this tragedy of life and of man in particular will demonstrate the illusion of such naive faith.”
- “those who try to eliminate the fear of death through artificial reasoning are totally
mistaken, because it is impossible to cancel an organic fear by way of abstract constructs. whoever seriously considers the question of death must be afraid. Even those who believe in eternity do so because they are afraid of death. there is in their faith a painful effort to save - even without an absolute certitude- the world of values in which they live and to which they contribute, an effort to defeat the nothingness inherent in the temporal and attain the universal in eternity. Death met without religious faith leaves nothing standing.”
- “yet other philosophies and doctrines say almost nothing about death.  the only valid attitude is absolute silence or a cry of despair.  some people maintain that the fear of death does not have a deeper justification, because as long as there is an i there is no death, and once dead there
is no i any longer. these people have forgotten about the very strange phenomenon of gradual agony. what comfort does this artificial distinction between the i and death offer a man who has a strong premonition of death?  what meaning can logical argument or subtle thought have for someone deeply imbued with a feeling of the irrevocable? all attempts to bring existential questions onto a logical plane are null and void.  philosophers are too proud to confess their fear of death and too
supercilious to acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness. their reflections on death exhibit
a hypocritical serenity; in fact, they tremble with fear more than anyone else. one should not forget that philosophy is the art of masking inner torments.”
- “the art of dying cannot be learned, because there is no technique, there are no rules. the irrevocability of agony is experienced by each individual alone, through infinite and intense suffering.  most people are unaware of the slow agony within themselves.  for them there is only
one kind of agony, the one immediately preceding the fall into absolute nothingness.  only such moments of agony bring about important existential revelations in consciousness. that is why they expect everything from the end instead of trying to grasp the meaning of a slow revelatory agony. the end will reveal too little, and they will die as ignorant as they have lived.”
- “isn't nothingness, then, salvation? but how can there be salvation in nothingness? if salvation
is nearly impossible through existence, how can it be possible through the complete absence of existence?  since there is no salvation either in existence or in nothingness, let this world with its eternal laws be smashed to pieces.”
- “the sensation of expansion toward nothingness present in melancholy has its roots in a weariness characteristic of all negative states. this weariness separates man from the world. life's intense rhythm, its organic inner pulse, weakens.  weariness is the first organic determinant of knowledge. because it creates the necessary conditions for man's differentiation from the world, weariness leads one to the perspective which places the world in front of man.”
- “man grows wings in melancholy not in order to enjoy the world but in order to be alone. what
is the meaning of loneliness in melancholy?  isn't it related to the feeling of interior and exterior infinity?”
- “melancholy detachment removes man from his natural surroundings.  his outlook on infinity
shows him to be lonely and forsaken. the sharper our consciousness of the world's infinity, the more acute our awareness of our own finitude. in some states this awareness is painfully depressing, but in melancholy it is less tormenting and sometimes even rather voluptuous.
the disparity between the world's infinity and man's finitude is a serious cause for despair; but
when one looks at this disparity in states of melancholy, it ceases to be painful and the world appears endowed with a strange, sickly beauty.”
- “nothing is important.  how important can it be that i suffer and think? My presence in this world will disturb a few tranquil lives and will unsettle the unconscious and pleasant naiveté
of others.  although i feel that my tragedy is the greatest in history- greater than the fall of empires - i am nevertheless aware of my total insignificance. i am absolutely persuaded that i am nothing in this universe; yet i feel that mine is the only real existence.  if i had to choose between the world and me, i would reject the world, its lights and laws, unafraid to glide alone in absolute nothingness.  although life for me is torture, i cannot renounce it, because i do not believe in the absolute values in whose name i would sacrifice myself.”
- “i wonder whether a truly metaphysical feeling is even possible without the disappearance of superficial forms?  one reaches the center of life only by purifying it of contingent and accidental
elements.”
- “metaphysical existentialism is born out of ecstasy in front of the world's primordial origins; it
is the ultimate intoxication, ecstatic bliss in the contemplation of essence.”
- “i see a form of madness, not of knowledge, in the ecstasy of life's ultimate origins. You cannot experience it except in solitude, when you feel as if you were floating above the world. solitude is the proper milieu for madness. it is noteworthy that even the skeptic can experience this kind of ecstasy. does not the madness of ecstasy reveal itself through this odd combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair?”
- “the world in which nothing is solved.  to doubt and yet to live - this is a paradox, though not a tragic one, since doubt is less intense, less consuming, than despair. abstract doubt, in which
one participates only partially, is more frequent, whereas in despair one participates totally and
organically.  not even the most organic and serious forms of doubt ever reach the intensity of despair.  in comparison with despair, skepticism is characterized by a certain amount of dilettantism and superficiality.  i can doubt everything, i may very well smile contemptuously at the world, but this will not prevent me from eating, from sleeping peacefully, and from marrying. in despair, whose depth one can fathom only by experiencing it, such actions are possible only with great effort. On the heights of despair, nobody has the right to sleep. thus a genuinely
desperate man cannot forget his own tragedy: his consciousness preserves the painful actuality of his subjective torment. doubt is anxiety about problems and things, and has its origins in the unsolvable nature of all big questions. if such questions could be solved, the skeptic would revert to more normal states. The condition of the desperate man in this respect is utterly different: if all
problems were solved, he would not be any less anxious, since his anxiety arises out of his own
subjective existence. Despair is the state in which anxiety and restlessness are immanent to existence. nobody in despair suffers from problems, but from his own inner torment and fire. it's a pity that nothing can be solved in this world. yet there never was and there never will be anyone who would commit suicide for this reason.”
- “one must descend all the circles of an inner hell to turn one's destiny into a subjective yet universal problem.” (Kierkegaard)
- “only great and dangerous contradictions betoken a rich spiritual life, because only they
constitute a mode of realization for life's abundant inner flow. people who know only a few spiritual states and never live on the edge do not have contradictions, because their limited
resources cannot form oppositions.”
- “rich spiritual life must know chaos and the effervescent paroxysm of illness, because in them
inspiration appears to be essential for creation and contradictions become expressions of high
inner temperatures. nobody who does not love chaos is a creator, and whoever is contemptuous of illness must not speak of the spirit.”
- “I know nothing more disgusting than death...it is ironic that one fears it the more one admires it. i must confess that i admire death's negativity. it is the only thing i can admire and yet not
love.  its grandeur and infinity impress me, but my despair is so vast that i don't even harbor the hope of death.  how could i love death?  one can only write about it in contradictory ways. whoever says that he knows something definite about death shows that he has not even a
premonition, although he bears it within himself. every man bears with him not only his life but also his death.”
- “an observation which, to my great regret, is always verifiable: only those are happy who never think or, rather, who only think about life's bare necessities, and to think about such things means not to think at all.  true thinking resembles a demon who muddies the spring of life or a sickness which corrupts its roots. to think all the time, to raise questions, to doubt your own destiny, to feel the weariness of living, to be worn out to the point of exhaustion by thoughts and life...” (Ha!)
- “i might become an animal who knows the history of philosophy. as to becoming superman, that
seems to me utter and ridiculous folly.  could there be a solution, approximate of course, in a sort of superconsciousness? couldn't one live beyond (not just on this side, toward animality) all
complex forms of consciousness, anxiety, agony, in a sphere of life where access to eternity would no longer be pure myth?”
- “what should i do? work for a social and political system, make a girl miserable? hunt for weaknesses in philosophical systems, fight for moral and esthetic ideals?  it's all too little.” (me- Renunciation)
- “beyond present-day common ideals and forms, one might breathe in a superconsciousness where the intoxication of eternity would do away with the qualms of this world, and where being would be just as pure and immaterial as nonbeing.”
- “to live in a bath of fire, transfigured by its rich glow – such is the state of immaterial purity where one is nothing but a dancing flame. freed from the laws of gravity, life becomes illusion
or dream.”
- “not everybody loses their innocence: therefore not everybody is unhappy...disintegration implies total loss of innocence, that lovely gift destroyed by knowledge, life's enemy.”
- “innocence is delight in natural charm...there are only two fundamental attitudes: the naive and the heroic...innocence is no longer an option, so there only remains heroism.  incapable of fulfillment and happiness... to be a hero - in the most universal sense of the word means to aspire to absolute triumph.  but such triumphs come only through death.  heroism means transcending life; it is a fatal leap into nothingness, even though the hero may not be aware that his energy springs from a life deprived of its normal supports. all that is innocence, and does not lead to it, belongs to nothingness. can one speak of the seductions of that they are much too mysterious to penetrate.”
- “spirit in life is an anomaly.  i have renounced so much, why should i not renounce spirit as well?  but besides being an illness of life, is not renunciation first and foremost an illness of
the spirit?”
- “i do not know what is right and what is wrong; what is allowed and what is not; i cannot judge and i cannot praise. there are no valid criteria and no consistent principles in the world...it surprises me that some people still concern themselves with a theory of knowledge. to tell the truth, i couldn't care less about the relativity of knowledge, simply because the world does not deserve to be known. at times i feel as if i had total knowledge, exhausting the content of this world; at other times the world around me does not make any sense.”
- “the feeling of cosmic loneliness, on the other hand, stems not so much from man's subjective agony as from an awareness of the world's isolation, of objective nothingness. it is as if all the
splendors of this world were to vanish at once, leaving behind the dull monotony of a cemetery.”
- “how i would love one day to see all people, young and old, sad or happy, men and women, married or not, serious or superficial leave their homes and their work places, relinquish their duties and responsibilities, gather in the streets and refuse to do anything anymore. at that moment, let slaves to senseless work, who have been toiling for future generations under the dire delusion that they contribute to the good of humanity, avenge themselves on the mediocrity of a sterile and insignificant life, on the tremendous waste that never permitted spiritual transfiguration.” (Karma Yoga, Maya)
- “let ideals be declared void; beliefs, trifles; art, a lie; and philosophy, a joke.” (Nihilism, Renunciation)
- “the feeling of utter confusion!  not to be able to differentiate, clarify, understand, or appreciate!  such a feeling would make any philosopher a poet, but not all philosophers experience it the feeling of utter confusion!  not to be able to differentiate, clarify, understand, or appreciate!  Such a feeling would make any philosopher a poet, but not all philosophers experience it with significant and durable intensity, for if they did, they could no longer philosophize abstractly and rigidly.  How a philosopher becomes a poet is like a drama. you
fall from a world of abstractions into a whirlwind of feelings, into all the fantastic shapes
and figures entangled in the soul.  how could the actor of a complicated drama of the soul in which, all at once, erotic anticipation clashes with metaphysical anxiety, fear of death with desire for innocence, total renunciation with paradoxical heroism despair with pride, forebodings
of madness with longings for anonymity, screams with silence, aspiration with nothingness how
could he still go on philosophizing in a systematic way?  There are men who started in the world
of abstract forms and ended in absolute confusion.  therefore they can only philosophize poetically. in the state of absolute confusion, only the delights and torments of madness still
matter.”
- “grace is an illusory state in which life negates its antinomies and transcends its demonic dialectic, in which contradictions, fatality, and the consciousness of the irrevocable temporarily vanish...transcending negativity is the essential characteristic of grace.”
- “only sickness gives birth to serious and deep feelings.”
- “he who has not experienced absolute fear, universal anxiety, cannot understand struggle, the madness of the flesh and of death.”
- “a graceful sense of existence does not lead to metaphysical revelations, to a vision of truth, to the sense of an ending which poisons every moment of life.”
- “pity is not only inefficient; it is also insulting.  and besides, how can you pity another when you
yourself suffer ignominiously.”
- “even today nobody can tell what is right or what is wrong...since reality is essentially irrational, why set rules, why distinguish the right from the wrong? morality cannot be saved; it's a mistake to believe otherwise.  yet there are those who maintain that in this world pleasure and sin are minor satisfactions which enjoy only a brief triumph and that only good deeds partake of
eternity.  they pretend that at the end of this world's misery, goodness and virtue will win but they have failed to see that, if eternity obliterates superficial pleasures, it does the same with virtue, good deeds, and moral actions. eternity does not lead to the triumph of either good or evil; it ravages all.” (me- Exactly! Ha!  Vivekananda- maya, Tillich- doubt as being an intrinsic part of true faith, Kierkegaard and how the infinite scared him, how St. Therese said that thoughts concerning the Infinite brought on even deeper anguish)
- “it is silly to condemn the epicureans in the name of eternity. how is suffering rather than pleasure going to make me immortal? from a purely objective point of view, is there any significant difference between one man's agony and another's pleasure? whether you suffer or not, nothingness will swallow you forever.” (Maya)
- “the experience of eternity therefore depends on intensity of subjective feeling, and the way to eternity is to transcend the temporal...every experience of eternity presupposes a leap and a transfiguration, and few and far between are those capable of the tension necessary to arrive at the blissful contemplation of the eternal.”
- “time with its long train of individual moments is, if not unreal, irrelevant...without temporality, life loses its dramatic character...the experience of the eternity is void of life.”
- “why should i live in history, or worry about the social and cultural problems of the age?
i am weary of culture and history; i can no longer bring myself to embrace its torments and its aspirations. We must outstrip history, and we can do so only when past, present, and future cease to be important, when where and when we live becomes a matter of indifference...since there is no hierarchy of life-styles, everybody and nobody is right all at the same time...mankind's achievements could very well be great, but i do not care to know them.  I take greater comfort in the contemplation of eternity. in this world not worth so much as a breath, the only valid relation is that between man and eternity, not between man and history.”
- “by outstripping history, one acquires superconsciousness, an important ingredient of eternity. it takes you into the realm where contradictions and doubts lose their meaning, where you
forget about life and death. it is the fear of death that launches men on their quest for eternity...”
- “man tends to monopolize tragedy and suffering in the world: that's why salvation
for him is a burning insoluble question.  i am not proud to be a man, because i know only too
well what it is to be man.  Only those who have not experienced this state intensely are proud of it, because they intend to become men. their delight is natural: there are among men some who are not far above plants or animals, and therefore aspire to humanity. but those who know what it means to be man long to be anything but.”
- “magic is useful for small and inessential things, but powerless when confronted with metaphysical reality, which requires, most of the time, silence, something magical sensitivity is incapable of.  to live with an acute consciousness of fatality, of one's own impotence in the face of life's great problems, which you cannot even pose without tragically implicating yourself in existence, means to engage directly the capital question of life, that of inaccessible and unknowable infinity.”
- “you pretend that despair and agony are only preliminaries, that ideally one should overcome them if one is not to become an automaton.  you think joy is the only means of salvation and you despise all others?  You call the obsession with agony selfishness and find generous impulses only in joy? you offer us this joy; but how can we receive it from the outside? as long as it does not spring from our inner resources, help from the outside is quite useless. how easy it is to recommend joy to those who cannot be joyful!  do all those who are so eager to promote joy realize what it means to feel and fear madness closing in, to live all your life with the tormenting presentiment of madness, to which is added the even more persistent and certain consciousness of death?”
- “let us live the agony fully; let us live our inner tragedy absolutely and frenetically to the very end.”
- “...there is no true or false, only our spontaneous reactions.”
- “isn't intense subjectivity the way to attain universality, exactly as one enters eternity through the instant?  men value solitude so little!  they condemn the sterility of all that it has produced and give praise exclusively to social values, for they cherish the illusion that they have all contributed to their creation. they all aspire to great achievements through which they hope to attain immortality.  as if they will not crumble into dust!” (even Bach will be lost)
- “the enthusiast's ability to be constantly reborn raises him above life's demoniacal
temptations, the fear of nothingness, and the torments of agony.  his life has no tragic dimension, because enthusiasm is the only form of life totally opaque to death.  even grace - so similar to enthusiasm- has less of this irrational ignorance of death.  grace is full of melancholy charm; not so enthusiasm. my tremendous admiration for enthusiasts stems from my inability to comprehend how there can be such men in a world where death, nothingness, sadness, and despair keep sinister company. It makes one wonder, to see people who are never desperate.”
- “the enthusiast is preeminently an unproblematic person. he understands many things without ever knowing the agonizing doubts and the chaotic sensitivity of the problematic man.  the latter
cannot solve anything, because nothing satisfies him.  you will find in him neither the enthusiast's gift of abandon, his naive irrationality, nor the charming paradox of love in its purest state.”
- “the biblical myth of knowledge as sin is the most profound myth ever invented.  the enthusiast's euphoria is due to the fact that he is unaware of the tragedy of knowledge. why not say it? true knowledge is the most tenebrous darkness.”
- “the height of ecstasy is the final sensation, in which you feel you are dying because of all this light and darkness.  especially weird is the fact that ecstasy wipes out surrounding objects, familiar forms of the world, until ail that is left is a monumental projection of shadow and light.
it is hard to explain how this selection and purification takes place, why these immaterial shadows hold such sway over us.  how can we help attributing an absolute character to light and darkness when they are all that is left of the world's ecstasy?  the frequency with which ecstasy occurs in oriental religions, as well as in other forms of mysticism at all times, proves the rightness of our hypothesis.  the absolute is inside oneself, not outside, and ecstasy, this paroxysm
of interiority, reveals only inner shadows and glimmers of light.  next to them, the charm of light
and day fades quickly. ecstasy partakes of essence to such an extent that it gives an impression
of metaphysical hallucination.  pure essences, grasped through ecstasy, are immaterial, but their immateriality causes vertigo and obsession from which you cannot free yourself except by converting them into metaphysical principles.”
- “so you witnessed old age, pain, and death and told yourself that pleasure is an illusion and that the pleasure seekers do not understand the inconstancy of things.  then you shunned the world, persuaded that nothing will endure. "i will not return," you proclaimed, "before i have escaped birth, old age, and death."  there is much pride and suffering in every renunciation. instead
of retreating discreetly, without a big show of revolt and hatred, you denounce, emphatically
and haughtily, others' ignorance and illusions; you condemn their pleasures. the ascetics, who renounced life and fled into the desert, were convinced that they had overcome all human weaknesses.  the belief that they had access to a subjective eternity gave them the illusion of total liberation.  nonetheless, their condemnation of pleasure and their contempt for humanity betray their inability to actually free themselves.  were i to withdraw into the most fearsome desert, renounce everything, and live in absolute solitude, still I would never dream of despising men and their pleasure.   since I cannot really enter eternity through renunciation and solitude, since I shall die like the rest, why despise them, why call my way the only true one?  all the great prophets lack discretion and human understanding. i witness pain, old age, death, and i know that they cannot be overcome; but why should i spoil another's enjoyment with my knowledge?  suffering and the consciousness of its in escapability lead to renunciation; yet nothing would induce me, not even if i were to become a leper, to condemn another's joy. there is much envy in every act of condemnation. Buddhism and christianity are the revenge and the spite of those who suffer.” (Ha!)
- “the thought of renunciation is so bitter that it is hard to imagine how man ever came to
conceive of it.  he who in a moment of despair has not experienced a cold shiver, a sensation of ineluctable abandonment, cosmic death, and individual nothingness, has not experienced the terrifying preliminaries of renunciation.”
- “not living under the fierce desert sun, with just that one thought about eternity, are we to
become saints with roofs over our heads?”
- “a world full of philosophers, what a terrifying prospect! they should be all wiped out so that
life could go on naturally – blindly and irrationally.  i hate the wisdom of these men unmoved by truths, who do not suffer with their nerves, their flesh, and their blood. i like only vital, organic truths, the offspring of our anxiety.  those whose thoughts are alive are always right; there are no arguments against them.  and even if there were, they would not last long.  i wonder
how there can still be men searching for the truth.  do wise men not yet understand that truth cannot be?” (Taoism, Sean Carroll and others discussing the multi-verse without any discomfort whatsoever)
- “once you've negated everything and done away completely with all forms of existence, once nothing can survive in the path of your negativity, who can you turn to, laughing or crying, if not
your own self?  once you have witnessed the fall of the entire world, there is nothing left but for you to fall too.  the infinite character of irony cancels all of life's contents.  i'm not speaking here of elegant, refined irony, born of a sense of superficial pride and superiority - the irony some use to show off their detachment from the world – but of the tragic, bitter irony of despair. genuine irony replaces tears, convulsions, or even a grotesque and criminal grin.”
- “the essence of social life is injustice.” (me- very Earthly reflections on “poverty”)
- “...infinity, both in time and space, leads to nothing.  how can we accomplish anything in the future when we have behind us an eternity in which nothing was accomplished? if the world had had any meaning, it would have been revealed to us by now and we would know it. how can i continue to believe that it will be disclosed in the future when it has not been made manifest yet? but the world has no meaning; irrational at the core, it is, moreover, infinite.  meaning is conceivable only in a finite world, where one can reach something, where there are limits to stop
our regression, clear points of reference, where history moves toward a goal envisioned
by the theory of progress.”
- “to live infinity, as well as to meditate a long time upon it, is the most terrifying lesson
in anarchy and revolt one can ever learn.  infinity shakes you to the roots of your being, disorganizes you, but it also makes you forget the petty, the contingent, and the insignificant.”
- “how fortunate that, having lost all our hopes, we can still leap into infinity, dive into boundlessness, participate in the universal anarchy of its whirlwind!”
- “absolute becoming, infinity destroys anything that is formed, crystallized, or finished. isn't
music the art which best expresses infinity because it dissolves all forms into a charmingly ineffable fluidity.”
- “i have always wondered why those who have produced masterpieces in these domains have not all gone mad.  music more than any other art requires so much concentration that one could easily, after creative moments, lose one's mind.  all great composers ought to either commit suicide or become insane at the height of their creative powers.  are not all those aspiring to infinity on the road to madness?  normality, abnormality, are notions that no longer mean anything.  let us live in the ecstasy of infinity, let us love that which is boundless, let us destroy forms...”
- “since i will not die right away, nor regain my innocence, going through the same routine motions every day is sheer madness.  banality must be overcome at all costs and the way cleared for transfiguration.  how sad to see men bypass themselves, neglect their own destiny instead of rekindling the light they carry within them or getting drunk on their abysmal darkness!” (Tillich, Tolstoy, inward)
- “why not abandon this futile work and begin anew without repeating the same wasteful mistake?  is subjective consciousness of eternity not enough?  it is the feeling for eternity that the frenetic activity and trepidation of work has destroyed in us. work is the negation of eternity. the more goods we acquire in the temporal realm, the more intense our external work, the less accessible and farther removed is eternity.”
- “hence the limited perspective of active and energetic people, the banality of their thought and actions. i am not contrasting work to either passive contemplation or vague dreaminess, but to an unrealizable transfiguration; nevertheless, i prefer an intelligent and observant laziness to
intolerable, terrorizing activity.  to awaken the modern world, one must praise laziness. the lazy man has an infinitely keener perception of metaphysical reality than the active one.” (me- non-movement, Saints are Conquerors, Underhill thinks Quietism is misconstrued as 'laziness' when in fact it's an undying participation with the Nothingness)
- “sadness, the inebriation and excitement of last moments. is not everything final?  what is the anxiety of nothingness if not the perverse joy of our final sadness, our exalted love for the eternity of nothingness and the transience of existence? can it really be that for us existence means exile, and nothingness, home?  i must struggle against myself, fly into a rage at my destiny, blow up all
resistance to my transfiguration; let there be only my desire for light and darkness!  let each one of my actions be either triumph or fall, flight or failure!  let life grow and die in me with the speed of a lightning bolt!  let not the pettiness and rationality of commonplace existence spoil the pleasures and torments of my inner chaos, the tragic delights of my final despair and joy!”
- “when men can no longer bear the monotony and the banality of ordinary existence, they will find in each experience of the absolute an opportunity to commit suicide. the impossibility
of surviving such extraordinary states of exaltation will destroy existence. no one will then doubt that it is possible to long for death after having listened to certain symphonies or admired a unique landscape.”
- “ To speak of suffering as the path to love means to know nothing of suffering's satanic essence.  you don't climb up the steps of suffering; you climb down.  they do not lead to heaven but to hell. the darkness at the bottom of the ladder of suffering is less eternal or infinite than the blinding light at the top of the ladder of joy.”
- “disjunction from the world through suffering leads to excessive interiorization and, paradoxically, to such a high level of consciousness that the world, with all its splendors and glooms, becomes exterior and transcendent.” (me- pantheistic paradox)
- “...however painful my agony, however great my isolation, the distance separating me from the world does nothing but render it more accessible.”
- “there's no salvation without the immediate. but man is a being who no longer knows the immediate.” (me- Jesus and anxiety about tomorrow, says think about today. Buddha talks about the present moment, etc)
- “when we have persuaded ourselves that there is no truth.  all salvation comes thenceforth,
even salvation through nothing.”
- “for those deprived of faith, an excess of subjectivity leads either to megalomania or self-denigration, to too much love or too much self-hatred. Either way, you spend yourself ahead of time.  subjectivity makes you either god or satan.”
- “man should stop being- or becoming - a rational animal. he should become a lunatic, risking everything for the sake of his dangerous fantasies, capable of exaltations, ready to die for all
that the world has as well as for what it has not.  each man's ideal should be to stop being a man. this can only be attained through absolute arbitrariness.”
- “nothing matters.  everything is possible, and yet nothing is. all is permitted, and yet again, nothing. no matter which way we go, it is no better than any other. it is all the same whether you
achieve something or not, have faith or not, just as it is all the same whether you cry or remain
silent. there is an explanation for everything, and yet there is none. everything is both real and
unreal, normal and absurd, splendid and insipid. there is nothing worth more than anything else, nor any idea better than any other. why grow sad from one's sadness and delight
in one's joy? What does it matter whether our tears come from pleasure or pain? love your unhappiness and hate your happiness, mix everything up, scramble it all! be a snowflake dancing
in the air, a flower floating downstream!  have courage when you don't need to, and be a coward
when you must be brave! who knows?  you may still be a winner!  and if you lose, does it really matter? is there anything to win in this world? all gain is a loss, and all loss is a gain. why always expect a definite stance, clear ideas, meaningful words?”
- “all efforts to attain happiness, on the other hand, are entirely futile. you can not retrace your steps once you've taken the path to unhappiness; it is the path of no return.  from being happy, one can become unhappy, so there are more unpleasant surprises in happiness than in unhappiness. the world seems right to us when we are happy; when unhappy, we wish the world were anything but what it is. though fully aware that the source of unhappiness is in us, we nevertheless turn a personal defect into a metaphysical deficiency.”
- “why do men insist on achieving something?  Would it not be better if they stood still under the sun in calm and silent immobility?  what is there to accomplish? why so much effort and ambition?  man has forgotten the meaning of silence.”
- “could morality still serve such a being- probably the most generous because also the most absurd, capable of renouncing the whole world, and consequently giving away all that can be
given?  generosity is incompatible with morality, that rationalization of customs, that mechanization of life.  Any generous act is absurd, a renunciation unheard of in the
ordinary man, who drapes himself in morality in order to hide his vulgar nullity.  all that is truly moral begins when we have done with morality.  the pettiness of its laws is never more evident than in its condemnation of vice, the expression of carnal tragedy born from the presence of the spirit in the flesh. vice is the tragedy of the flesh, the flesh bursting out of its own fatality, attempting to break the shackles imprisoning its passionate impulses.”
- “then you will think it useless to express an opinion, to take a stand, to make an impression; the noises you have renounced increase the anxiety of your soul.  after having struggled madly to solve all problems, after having suffered on the heights of despair, in the supreme hour of revelation, you will find that the only answer, the only reality, is silence.” (in 'nothing matters' he describes the Absurd Perspective that turns all and any action nonsensical.  He also refers to being saved from acting like just another 'clown' through silence)
- “a little knowledge is delightful; a lot, disgusting.  the more you know, the less you want to know.  he who has not suffered from knowledge has never known anything.”
- “fine psychological understanding is the product of a life of self-contemplation, a life which
sees itself in other lives as if in so many mirrors; for a psychologist, all men are fragments of himself...quickly exhausting men and their limited resources, the psychologist is easily bored, for he is not naive enough to have friends and is too self-conscious to have lovers.”
- “time...becomes an ever-growing nothingness, a dilating void, a threat from beyond.”

The Premonition of Madness- Cioran describes “ego-death” which is always said to be one of the most, if not the most, important parts of an experience of the Other, in exactly the same way as Eckhart, John of the Cross, Augustine, Luther, etc., but then goes on to describe the Nihilistic experience, which is the religious experience, as “madness”. What kind of culture would allow a 22 year old to conceive of such a terrifying experience as this to be “madness” in a pejorative sense? Jesus said the path was narrow!  The Nihilistic experience is madness, but it is also God.

Drawn and Quartered

- “History is the obstacle to ultimate revelation, the shackle we can strike off only if we have perceived the nullity of every event except the one that this very perception represents, and thanks to which we attain at moments to “the real truth,” i.e., to the victory over all truths.”
- “To escape our fate— what is the good of striving for that? Not that we must despair of finding a substitute ending. Yet it must be a likely one, one that has some chance of being realized. Man being what he is, can we admit that he might be granted the opportunity of subsiding in the peace of decay, amid the benefits of decrepitude?” (me- Tillich: the meaning of life is to despair over the meaninglessness of life)
- “The abyss is in ourselves and outside of ourselves, it is yesterday’s presentiment, today’s question, tomorrow’s certainty.” (me- The Kingdom of God is Within You, turn inward, Vivekananda, renouncing, selflessness)
- “Since in us has awakened the evil that slumbered in the remainder of the living, it remains for us to destroy ourselves so that they might be saved.” (me- selflessness, self-abnegation)
- “And the gods— have we not turned against them as well, outraged to see that they were conscious without suffering from the fact, while for us consciousness and shipwreck are one and the same thing?” (me- rejecting the idea of a personal God.  Another tenant of the Nihilistic Mystical experience.)
- “At the climax of our Void, we will be doomed, then, to the indignity of a complete erosion, worse than a sudden catastrophe which would be honorable after all, even glamorous. Let us be confident, let us put our bets on catastrophe, more in accord with our genius and our tastes. Let us take one step further, let us suppose it to be upon us, let us treat it as a fail accompli. According to all appearances, it will include certain survivors, a few lucky ones who will have had the good fortune to contemplate its occurrence and to draw lessons from it. Their first concern will certainly be to abolish the memory of the old humanity, of all the enterprises that have discredited and destroyed it. Turning against the cities, they will seek to complete their ruin, to erase all traces of them. One rachitic tree will be worth more in their eyes than a museum or a temple. No more schools; on the other hand, courses in oblivion and unlearning to celebrate the virtues of inattention and the delights of amnesia. The disgust inspired by the sight of any book, frivolous or serious, will extend to all Knowledge, which will be referred to with embarrassment or dread as if it were an obscenity or a scourge. To bother with philosophy, to elaborate a system, to attach oneself to it and believe in it, will appear as an impiety, a provocation, and a betrayal, a criminal complicity with the past.” (me- maybe stop writing 'me'? Vivekananda- 'good to be born in church, but not die in a church, 'lack of spiritual progression', Unity in different sects, perennialism, reject literalism)
- “It is doubtless distressing that we must confront the final phase of the historical process at the moment when, having liquidated our old beliefs, we lack any metaphysical assets, any substantial reserves of the Absolute. Surprised by the death agony, dispossessed of everything, we skirt that flattering nightmare experienced by all who had the privilege of finding themselves at the heart of a conspicuous débâcle. If, with the courage to look things in the face, we had that of suspending our course, if only for an instant, this respite, this pause on a global scale, would suffice to reveal to us the nature of the precipice over which we hang, and the resulting dread would quickly be converted into prayers or lamentations, into a salutary convulsion.”
- “What advantage would having faith be to me, since I understand Meister Eckhart just as well without it?”
- “Friendship being incompatible with truth, only the mute dialogue with our enemies is fruitful.”
- “I would not want to live in a world drained of all religious feeling. I am not thinking of faith but of that inner vibration which, independent of any belief in particular, projects you into, and sometimes above God.”
- “If the narrative of the Fall is so striking, it is because its author describes neither entities nor symbols: he sees a God strolling in a garden, a rural God, as one exegete has so accurately characterized Him.”
- “To detest someone is to want him to be anything but what he is. T. writes me that I am the man he loves most in the world . . . but he urges me at the same time to forgo my obsessions, to change my ways, to become different, to break with the man I am. Which is to say that he rejects my being.”
- “What a pity that “nothingness” has been devalued by an abuse of it made by philosophers unworthy of it!”
- “Whoever speaks the language of utopia is more alien to me than a reptile from another geological era.”
- “A Tantric ritual: during the initiation ceremony, you are given a mirror in which you see your own image. Contemplating it, you realize you are nothing but that, i.e., nothing. To what end, so many pretenses, so many airs and graces, when it is so easy to comprehend one’s insignificance?”
- “Plotinus experienced only four moments of ecstasy; Ramana Maharshi, but one. What does the number matter! If anyone is to be pitied, it is the man who has never had even an inkling of such things, and who speaks of them from hearsay.”
- “To be is to be cornered.”
- “In flawed families, a scion appears who dedicates himself to the truth and who ruins himself in its pursuit.”
- “Once one has understood, it would be best to drop dead on the spot. What is to understand? What we have really grasped cannot be expressed in any way at all, and cannot be transmitted to anyone else, not even to oneself, so that we die without knowing the exact nature of our own secret.”
- “One is and remains a slave as long as one is not cured of hoping.”
- “When I see someone fighting for some cause or other, I try to know what is happening in his mind and what can be the source of his obvious lack of maturity. The rejection of resignation is perhaps a sign of “life,” never in any case of perspicacity or simply of reflexion. The sane man never lowers himself to protest. He scarcely consents to indignation. Taking human affairs seriously attests to some secret flaw.”
- “I do not struggle against the world, I struggle against a greater force, against my weariness of the world.”
- “I have less and less discernment as to what is good and what evil. When I make no distinction whatever between the two, supposing I reach this point some day— what a step forward! Toward what?”
- “Get hold of yourself, be confident once more, don’t forget that it is not given to just anyone to have idolized discouragement without succumbing to it.” (Ha!)
- “The further one advances into age, the more one runs after honors. Perhaps, in fact, vanity is never more active than on the brink of the grave. One clings to trifles in order not to realize what they conceal, one deceives nothingness by something even more null and void.”
- “To try curing someone of a “vice,” of what is the deepest thing he has, is to attack his very being, and indeed this is how he himself understands it, since he will never forgive you for wanting him to destroy himself in your way and not in his.”
- “The apparition of life? A temporary madness, a prank, a whim of the elements, a vagary of matter. The only ones entitled to grumble are the individual beings, pitiable victims of a passing fancy.”
- “The only profound thinkers are the ones who do not suffer from a sense of the ridiculous.”
- “In my childhood, a profound shock when I heard my father, back from the cemetery, tell how a young mother who had lost her baby daughter burst out laughing at the moment the coffin was lowered into the grave. Fit of madness? Yes and no. For when we attend a funeral and the absolute deception is suddenly unmasked, do we not have a craving to react precisely like that mother? It is too much— it is almost a provocation: nature exaggerates. We conceive that we might collapse in hilarity.”
- “We are all of us in error, the humorists excepted. They alone have discerned, as though in jest, the inanity of all that is serious and even of all that is frivolous.” (me- symbolism, finite/infinite distinction)
- “I abide by appearances, I note what they are and adhere to them only to the degree that, as a living being, I cannot do otherwise. I act like other people, I perform the same deeds they do, but I identify myself with neither my words nor my actions, I bow to customs and laws, I pretend to share the convictions, i.e., the prejudices, of my fellow citizens, while knowing that in the last analysis I am quite as unreal as they. What then is the skeptic? —A ghost: a conformist ghost.”
- “Life is more and less than boredom, though it is in boredom and by boredom that we discern what life is worth. Once boredom insinuates itself into you, once you fall under its invisible hegemony, everything else seems insignificant. The same might be said of suffering. Yes, indeed. But suffering is localized, whereas boredom evokes an evil without site or support, only that indefinable nothing that erodes you . . . A pure erosion, whose imperceptible effect slowly transforms you into a ruin unnoticed by others and almost unnoticed by yourself.” (Tillich)
- “To die at sixty or at eighty is harder than at ten or at thirty. Habituation to life, there’s the rub. For life is a vice— the greatest one of all. Which explains why we have so much difficulty ridding ourselves of it.”
- “When I happen to be satisfied with everything, even with God and myself, I immediately react like the man who, on a brilliant day, torments himself because the sun is bound to explode in a few billion years.”
- “Of two enemies at odds, it is unlikely that only one should be in the right. When we listen to them one after the other, we yield, if we are in good faith, to the arguments of each, at the risk of looking like a weathercock, of being, in short, too much of a philosopher.”
- “What is evil? It is what is done with a view to happiness in this world.”
- “Everything is nothing, including the consciousness of nothing.”
- “Everything that happens is at once natural and inconceivable. This conclusion is unavoidable, whether we consider great or trivial events.”
- “Everything I have ventured, everything I have held forth on all my life is indissociable from what I have experienced. I have invented nothing, I have merely been the secretary of my sensations.”
- “We can conceive of eternity only by eliminating all the perishable, all that counts for us. Eternity is absence, being that fills none of the functions of being; it is privation erected into . . . something or other, hence it is nothing or, at most, an estimable fiction.” (amazing! God is Nothing!)
- “Undeniable sign of spiritual nonfulfillment: every passionate reaction to blame, that twinge at the heart whenever we are reproached in one way or another. This is the cry of the old Adam in each of us, it proves we have not yet conquered our origins. So long as we do not aspire to be scorned, we are like the others, like those precisely whom we scorn.”
- “X, who instead of looking at things directly has spent his life juggling with concepts and abusing abstract terms, now that he must envisage his own death, is in desperate straits. Fortunately for him, he flings himself, as is his custom, into abstractions, into commonplaces illustrated by jargon. A glamorous hocus-pocus, such is philosophy. But ultimately, everything is hocus-pocus, except for this very assertion that participates in an order of propositions one dares not question because they emanate from an unverifiable certitude, one somehow anterior to the brain’s career.”
- “It makes no sense to say that death is the goal of life. But what else is there to say?”
- “We regret not having had the courage to make such and such a decision; we regret much more having made one— any one. Better no action than the consequences of an action!”
- “All things considered, philosophy is not so contemptible: to hide oneself under more or less objective truths, to disclose oppressions that apparently do not concern us, to cultivate faceless dreads, to camouflage calls for help by the splendors of language . . . Philosophy? An anonymous cry...”
- “Everyone is mistaken, everyone lives in illusion. At best, we can admit a scale of fictions, a hierarchy of unrealities, giving preference to one rather than to another; but to choose, no, definitely not that...” (me- Vivekananda, Tillich, Symbolism, Becker)
- “Boredom, which seems to search out everything to its root, actually searches out nothing, because it descends only into itself and sounds only its own void.”
- “As soon as one returns to Doubt (if it could be said that one has ever left it), undertaking anything at all seems not so much useless as extravagant. No joyful companion, Doubt works deep within you like a disease or, even more effectively, like a faith.” (me- Tillich exactly, pg. 25 dynamics of faith)
- “To that friend who tells me he is bored because he cannot work, I answer that boredom is a higher state, and that we debase it by relating it to the notion of work.”
- “Get hold of yourself, be confident once more, don’t forget that it is not given to just anyone to have idolized discouragement without succumbing to it.” (me- Vivekananda)
- “After all, why should ordinary people want to contemplate the End, especially when we see the condition of those who do?” (Ha! Bad PR)
- “Only the perception of the Void allows us to triumph over death. For if everything lacks reality, why should death be allowed it?”
- “A terrible yet endurable mortification: to be born among a people that will never be mentioned.”

The Trouble With Being Born

- “The further men get from God, the farther they advance into the knowledge of religions.”
- “Existence = Torment.  The equation seems obvious to me, but not to one of my friends.  How to convince them?  I cannot lend him my sensations; yet only they would have the power to persuade him, to give him that additional dose of ill-being he has so insistently asked for all this time.”
- “The West: a sweet-smelling rottenness, a perfumed corpse.”
- “...Do we think of Buddha withdrawing from the world on account of his contemporaries?”
- “Life would become endurable only among a humanity which no longer have any illusions in reserve, a humanity completely disabused and delighted to be so.”
- “Life is nothing; death, everything.  Yet there is nothing which is death, independent of life.  It is precisely this absence of autonomous, distinct reality which makes death universal; it has no realm of its own, it is omnipresent, like everything which lacks identity, limit, and bearing; an indecent infinitude.” (me- A Pessimist's description of God)
- “When someone complains that his life has come to nothing, we need merely remind him that life itself is an analogous situation, if not worse.”
- “The perception of the Precarious raised to the level of vision, of mystical experience.”
- “Explosive force of any mortification.  Every vanquished desire affords us power.  We have the more hold over this world the further we withdraw from it, the less we adhere to it.  Renunciation confers an infinite power.”
- “'All is suffering' – modernized, the Buddhist expression runs: 'All is nightmare.'”

The Undelivered (within The New Gods)- “The void allows us to erode the idea of being; but it is not drawn into this erosion itself; it survives an attack which would be self-destructive for any other idea.” (me- God)

- “And to understand signifies to discern the degree of awakening to which a being has achieved, in his capacity to perceive the sum of unreality which enters into each phenomenon.” (me- can you imagine the thing you find most valuable in this world as worthless?  Can you imagine your most cherished anything as meaningless?)
- “Beatitude is not compatible with this world.  It is for beatitude that the hermit cuts all his moorings, for beatitude that he destroys himself.” (me- Maya)
- “All our beliefs being intrinsically superficial and governing only appearances, it follows that all are on the same level, at the same degree of unreality.” (me- limitations of language, the need for symbolism and myth, religious pluralism, anti-literalism, etc.)
- “Every day we should honor someone, creature or object, by renouncing them.”
- “The void is nothingness stripped of its negative qualifications, nothingness transfigured.  If we should manage to develop a taste for it, our relations with the world are transformed; something in us
