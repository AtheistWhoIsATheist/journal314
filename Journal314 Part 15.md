[START PART 15/15]
nflict with anxiety, never mind a true attempt at embracing/confronting anxiety; put in stronger terms: a chasing after the anxiety, i.e. a participation with the Other, with the Nothingness of this world.

Heidegger says that the 'call' does not 'report events' and that it 'keeps quite', that it is 'indefinite', indefinable, finite/infinite distinction, it is a call of oneself by oneself (Vivekananda and eastern/mystical conceptions of 'unity' or 'all is one'.  'Uncanniness' is 'covered up' within the world, everyday events and 'goings ons'.  The others will not understand this because they repress their true Self.  The 'call' which 'says nothing' is yet, say Heidegger, still a 'positive'.  I couldn't agree more, the Nihilism is God, but not the religious/moral law giver as understood by the masses.

---

Guilt

“Uncanniness brings this entity face to face with its undisguised nullity, which belongs to the possibility of its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.”

“...this thrownness as a null basis which it has to take up into existence.”

“This calling-back in which conscience calls forth, gives Dasein to understand that Dasein itself- the null basis for its null projection, standing in the possibility of its Being- is to bring itself back to itself from its lostness in the 'they'; and this means that it is guilty.” Guilt is therefore not a worldly guilt of 'failing' to not do what others expect, or a 'breaching of a moral requirement', etc.  It is understanding that Guilt is fundamentally Dasein since there is no grounding or basis for existing in any way.  All actions are absurd, the natural self cannot possibly Transcend its worldly self in order to 'reach' the Authentic Self.  The Guilt is because of the finite/infinite gap; the world drags us down, no matter how hard we try, we cannot do this ourselves. Is this the concept of 'Salvation through Grace only”?   Is 'Guilt' the finite/infinite distinction?  Seems to be.

This clash, battle, unbridgable gap of the finite/infinite allows for a Heidegger to live most of his life away from people in a cabin, to write Being and Time, live in a secluded cabin most of his life, and yet also join the Nazi party.  A person cannot be Authentic!  Heidegger's 'Authentic' man is an ideal in itself; it is something to pursue, rather than achieve.

“Thus Being-a-basis means never to have power over one's ownmost Being from the ground up.”

“Care itself, in its very essence, is permeated with nullity through and trough.   Thus 'care'- Dasein's Being- means, as thrown projection, Being-the-basis of a nullity (and this being-the-basis is itself null). This means that Dasein as such is guilty, if our formally existential definition of 'guilt' as 'Being-the-basis of a nullity' is indeed correct.”  (finite/infinite gap, estrangement)

59. “Conscience is the call of care from the uncanniness of Being-in-the-world- the call which summons Dasein to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-guilty.”
After speaking of 'the call' and the wonderful description of the Nihilistic experience, Heidegger goes on to push the 'theological' interpretation of his concepts even further with this quote: “It is easy to see that the conscience which used to be an 'effluence of the divine power' now becomes a slave of Pharisaism.”

1. “We miss a 'positive' content in that which is called, because we expect to be told something currently useful about assured possibilities of 'taking action' which are available and calculable.  This expectation has its basis within the horizon of that way of interpreting which forces Dasein's existence to be subsumed under the idea of a business procedure that can be regulated...The call of conscience fails to give any such 'practical' injunctions, solely becayse it summons Dasein to existence, to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self.  With the maxims which one might be led to expect- maxims which could be reckoned up unequivovally- the conscience would deny existence nothing less than the very possibility of taking action.”  (this is indeed correct, hence quietism, solitude, non-movement, etc. However, Heidegger then mentions one of his seemingly few 'optimistic' spins on his conceptions that are, to me, wholly Other and world renouncing; as he does with suicide.  He seems to try to 'push forward' with action in a similar, yet equally unsubstantial way, as he 'rids' suicide as being an option for Dasien.  I am not sure if he himself believes this, or if this is a 'malfunction' on his part, or maybe even an inauthenticity in order to not seem utterly 'psychotic' to the 'they',

Pg. 323, 57., 161 of 294- “And yet, if the caller- who is 'nobody', when seen after the manner of the world- is interpreted as a power, this seems to be a dispassionate (a pushing off of responsibility to embrace the Self, to participate, to rush towards the Nothingness) recognition of something that one can 'come across Objectively'.  When seen correctly, however, this interpretation is only a fleeing in the face of the conscience- a way for Dasein to escape by slinking away from that thin wall by which the 'they' is separated, as it were, from the uncanniness of its Being.  This interpretation of the conscience passes itself off as recognizing the call in the sense of a voice which is 'universally binding, and which speaks in a way that is 'not just subjective'.  Furthermore, the 'universal' conscience becomes exalted to a 'world-conscience', which still has the phenomenal character of an 'it' and 'nobody', yet which speaks- there in the individual 'subject'- as this indefinite something.” (Just WOW, make sure to remember that 'This' interpretation is his interpretation that is being contrasted with the everyday conception of 'conscience', I wanted to italicize this entire section because it is so substantial, not to confuse it with Heidegger's own italics.  This is a great 'middle ground' between the Naturalistic and Theistic interpretations of the 'conscience' being either entirely material or having the misconception of a 'God-like character with human qualities/a immaterial soul that has human qualities)

1. “A free-floating call from which 'nothing ensues' is an impossible fiction when seen existentially.  With regard to Dasein, 'that nothing ensues' signifies something positive.”  (non-movement, for one.  The nothing of the world, 'wakes one up' to the Nothingness that is the ground of being)
2. “We miss a 'positive' content in that which is called, because we expect to be told something currently useful about assured possibilities of 'taking action' which are available and calculable.” ((Ha!  There is no 'concern' for this world, only in a rushing after/participation with the Other as a necessarily limited finite being)
3. “As the 'they-self, the particular Dasein has been dispersed into the 'they', and must first find itself.”
4. Proximally Dasein is 'they', and for the most part remains so (the path is narrow).  If Dasein discovers the world in its own way and brings it close, if it discloses to itself its own authentic Being, then this discovery of the 'world' and this disclosure of Dasein are always accomplished as a clearing-away of concealments and obscurities, as a breaking up of the disguises with which Dasein bars its own way. (through idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity. A disolvement of boundaries is what is needed, a participation/embracing/a rushing towards the Nothingness which is brought up with the help of anxiety)

pg. 173, 86 of 294, 29. “Both the undisturbed equanimity and the inhibited ill-humour of our everyday concern, the way we slip over from one to the other, or slip off into bad moods, are by no means nothing ontologically, even if these phenomena are left unheeded as supposedly the most indifferent and fleeting in Dasein.”  (Vivekananda- the most impressive things about human beings is that they see and live around death at all times, yet never think that they will die themselves, i.e. maya)

pg. 173, 86 of 294, 29, “The pallid, evenly balanced lack of mood, which is often persistent and which is not to be mistaken for a bad mood, is far from nothing at all.  Rather it is in this that Dasein becomes satiated with itself. Being has become manifest as burden (my italics).  Why that should be, one does not know.  And Dasein cannot know anything of the sort...”  (this seems to be the concept of 'doubt' within 'faith'.  The exact grounding or flowing from with which the world becomes insignificant, or a burden, cannot be known to us, but that it is still 'far from nothing'.  I think this is either leaves the door open for Heidegger to not get caught in the trap of a simple theology or the 'they', yet it does explicitly state its significance as 'something'.

1. “Furthermore, a mood of elation can alleviate the manifest burden of Being; that such a mood is possible also discloses the burdensome character of Dasein, even while it alleviates the burden.”
2. “'To be disclosed' does not mean 'to be known as this sort of thing'.  And even in the most indifferent and inoffensive everydayness the Being of Dasein can burst forth as a naked 'that it is and has to be. The pure 'that it is' shows itself, but the 'whence' and the 'whither' remain in darkness.” (again, this sounds like the necessary condition of doubt due to the finite/infinite gap; in other words, human beings estrangement, 'not at home', uncanniness within this world)
3. “In an ontico-existentiell sense, Dasein for the most part evades the Being which discloses the mood.” (The fleeing, the distractions, diversions, the covering up, always-have-to-be happy attitudes)
4. “The expression 'throwness' is meant to suggest the facticity of its being delivered over.”  (the given fact that human beings just 'show up on the scene', arbitrarily here instead of there, in this place instead of that, from these parents instead of those, etc.)
5. On the 'they' character's expression/reaction to their 'throwness'-

“As an entity which has been delivered over to its Being, it remains also delivered over to the fact that it must always have found itself- but found itself in a way of finding which arises not so much from a direct seeking as rather from a fleeing.  The way in which the mood discloses is not one in which we at throwness, but one in which we turn towards or turn away.  For the most part the mood does not turn towards the burdensome character of Dasein which is manifest in it, and least of all does it do so in the mood of elation when this burden has been alleviated.  It is always by way of a state-of-mind that this turning away is what it is.” (my italics)
29. “Existentially, a state-of-mind implies a disclosive submission to the world, out of which we can encounter something that matters to us.” (Ha!  We 'submit' the to world, its null possibilities, we flee, run, distract from the true Self, we get caught up in the 'they' and lose our true Self)

What is Metaphysics?

- “As surely as we never get a sure grasp of the generality of be-ing in itself, just assurely do we all the same find ourselves somehow placed in the midst of the generality of bare be-ing. In the end, there continues to be [besteht]an essential difference between getting a grasp of the whole of be-ing in itself and finding oneself in the midst of be-ing as a whole.  The former is impossible in principle. The latter happens all the time in our existence. Of course, it looks just as though in our everyday comings and goings we were holding fast to only just this or that [kind of] be-ing, as though we were lost in this or that realm of be-ing. But no matter how fragmented the daily round may seem, it always maintains be-ing in the unity of a "whole," although only in the shadows.  Even then and precisely just then, when we are not especially busy with things, this "as a whole" overcomes us; for example, in genuine boredom.  This is a long way off far off when this or that book or play, job or leisure activity, is boring. It breaks out when "it's boring." _Profound boredom, like a silent fog insinuating itself in the depths of existence, pulls things, others and oneself into it altogether with remarkable indifference. Such boredom reveals be-ing as a whole._”

- “Does such being attuned in which no-thing itself is brought before us happen in human existence?” (oh, indeed it does!)
- “This event is possible and happens, though only rarely and only for an instant, in the fundamental mood of dread [Angst]. In this sense, dread does not refer to the regularly occurring anxiety that has its source in the fearfulness that so easily appears in us. Dread is fundamentally different from fear. We are afraid of this or that determinate [kind of] be-ing which threatens us in this or that regard. Fear of . . . is also in every case being afraid of something determinate. Since fear has about it the limitation of an "of what" and "about what," the frightening and frightful become bound by that in which one finds himself. In striving to save himself from it, from this determinate [something], one becomes unsure of himself with regard to everything else, that is, "in a panic" about everything.  Dread does not give rise to such confusion. On the contrary, an odd calm pervades it. Dread is indeed always dread of . . ., but not of this or that. Dread of. . .is always dread about. . ., but not about this or that. The indeterminacy of and about what we are in dread is not some sort of failure of determinacy, but rather the essential impossibility of determinacy. This is illustrated by the following familiar explanation.  In dread, as we say, "something is uncanny." What do we mean by "something" and "is"? We cannot say what the uncanny something is about. There is something like this about the "as a whole”: all things and we ourselves sink into indifference.  Not in the sense of merely disappearing, but rather, in its very moving away, it turns to us. This moving away of be-ing as a whole that closes in on us in dread pressures us.  There's nothing to get a hold on.  All that remains and comes over us in the slipping away of be-ing is this "no-thing. "Dread reveals no-thing.” (every thing becomes Nothing, all actions become the same, the Absurd Perspective, all finitudes become Nothing)
- “We are "suspended" in dread.  More clearly, dread leaves us hanging because it brings on the slipping away of be-ing. So it is that we actual human beings slip away from ourselves in the midst of be-ing. For at bottom this is not uncanny to you or me, but rather "it" is like that. In the shuddering of this suspense, where one can hold on to nothing, only really being there [Da-sein] remains.”
- “Dread strikes us dumb.  Because be-ing as a whole slips away and straight away no-thing rushes in, every saying "Is" about it is silent in the face of it. That in the uncanniness of dread we even often attempt to break the empty stillness with random chatter is only proof of [the] present [of] no-thing. That dread discloses no-thing is then immediately confirmed when dread has eased off. In light of what we had just seen while it was still fresh in our memory, we are forced to say that that about and of which we were in dread was "really" nothing at all. Indeed, no-thing itself, as such, was there.”  (Ha! Almost an exact quote from Being and Time
- “This demands that we transform our human being into its openness (dread effects this transformation in us) so that we can grasp the nothing that shows up in dread exactly as it shows up. It also demands that we expressly avoid all characterizations of the nothing that do not come from a corresponding experience of the nothing.”  (this is so important.  He states, multiple times, in Being and Time that one cannot rush to the extremes of God or Naturalism, but needs to focus on the human experience of Nothingness)
- “In dread, being as a whole becomes untenable.”
- “In dread there is found a giving way to..., which is admittedly not so much a fleeing as a spellbound calm.”  (something that is 'overwhelming', that overwhelms)
- “In the clear night of dread's no-thing, the original openness of being as such arises for the first time in such a way that it is [a kind of] being and not no-thing.” (In Being and Time, 56. 57. 58. 59, even thought the 'call' does not give any 'practical information' or specifics in which in can communicate to another, there is a 'positive' content to the seeming 'empty' experience, I would call this 'God' or at least some aspect of something Other, rather than just a naturalistic explanation, i.e. 'the call seems like its coming from me, and beyond me'- found in 57.)

- “Being there means beholdenness to no-thing.”

- “Beholden to no-thing, existence is already beyond being as a whole. We call this being above and beyond being transcendence.”

- “If existence were not of essence fundamentally transcending, which now means, were it not already beholden to no-thing, then it could not relate itself to being and so not even to itself. Without [the] original manifestness of no-thing, no selfhood and no freedom.”  (Nothing brings one to God.  Maybe a better way to put it, is that the Nothing breaks open the mysterious abyss of the Other)
- “But now, finally, we must put into words a reservation we have so far withheld. If existence only relates itself to being by being aimed in advance at no-thing in order to be able to exist, and if no-thing originally becomes manifest only in dread, must we not then remain permanently suspended in this dread in order to be able to exist at all? Yet have we ourselves not already admitted that this original dread is rare? But above all, all of us exist and relate ourselves to being which we ourselves are not and which we ourselves are—without such dread. Is this not an arbitrary finding and the no-thing attributed to it an exaggeration? (Being and Time- 53. at the very end Heidegger admits that this 'being-towards-death' seems 'fantastical' and further asks if this 'position' of anxiety is something that reason even demands of us)
- “Now what does it mean that this original dread happens only in rare instances?  Nothing other than this: no-thing is at first and for the most part disguised in its originality. But how? By our getting lost in being in certain ways. The more we turn to being in our dealings, the less we let being as such slip away, the more we turn away from no-thing. Thus all the more certainly are we forced into the public superficialities of existence.” (as to whether this position of anxiety is something that can be held to at all times, is patently not possible.  This is due to 'always falling' into everydayness, 74.)
- “That existence is pervaded by nihilating behavior attests to the permanent and indeed obscured manifestness of no-thing that dread originally discloses. But this means original dread is suppressed for the most part in existence. Dread is there. It's only napping. Its breath permanently trembles in existence, only slightly in the apprehensive, and inaudibly in the "Uh húh!" and "Húh uh!" of those who are busy; best of all in the reserved, surest of all at the heart of existence that is daring. But this happens only in those for whom it expends itself in order to preserve the ultimate greatness of existence.”
- “For the daring, dread is not an opponent of joy or even of the comfortable pleasures of quiet busyness. It shares a secret bond with the cheerfulness and mildness of creative yearning.”
- “Original dread can awaken in existence at any moment. It does not need wakening by an unaccustomed eventuality for that. The depth of its sway corresponds to the scarcity of its possible occasioning.  It is permanently on the verge and yet only seldom comes into play to hold us in suspense.  The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread makes man the placeholder of no-thing. We are so finite that we are not even able to bring ourselves face to face with no-thing by our own will and resolve. So deeply is mortality buried in our existence that it denies our freedom its very own and deepest finiteness.”  (very poetic expression of the 'rarity' of the Nihilistic experience)
- “The beholdenness of existence to no-thing on the basis of hidden dread is the surmounting of being as a whole, transcendence.”
- “Pure being and pure no-thing is the same." This proposition of Hegel's (Science of Logic) is correct.  Being and no-thing belong together, not because both of them agree in their indeterminacy and immediacy,  but rather because being itself is in essence finite and revealed only in the transcendence of existence enduring no-thing.”  (this sounds like a good expression of 56. 57. 58. 59., the 'positive' content of Nothing)
- “Being as a whole first comes to itself in accordance with its very own possibility, that is, only in the no-thing of existence.” (the 'nothing of the world', 68. b)
- why science needs to be grounded in this interpretation of metaphysics, i.e. 'take on' the Nothing through facing the uncanniness and anxiety of existence- “Only because no-thing is manifest at the heart of existence can the full strangeness of being come over us. Only if the strangeness of being impresses us does it waken us and open us up to wonder. Only on the basis of wonder, that is, the manifestness of no-thing, does the "Why?" come up.” (this seems to be the reason why most scientists do not understand the consequences of their theories, let alone world-views.  They are not motivated by the terror of existence, but rather are totally content, i.e. they are unaware of the assumptions they are making or the consequences of their ideas, or both, philosophy/science must be motivated not simply by 'wonder' by through despair, this allows one too look 'deeper' and ask the 'why' questions that seek the ground of a thing, subject, etc.)
- “Human existence can relate to being only if it is itself beholden to no-thing.  Going above and beyond be-ing is of the essence of existence.” (this is the 'participation' of transcendence)
- “Philosophy can never be measured by the yardstick of the idea of science.” (Ha!)
- “Philosophy comes about only through our own life's undergoing a curious engagement with the fundamental possibilities of existence as a whole. Decisive for this engagement is, first of all, making room for be-ing as a whole; next, letting oneself come to no-thing, that is, becoming free of the idols which everyone has and among [which] weare in the habit of losing our way; finally, letting this suspense range out into what it permanently swings round to in the basic question of metaphysics which no-thing itself forces on us: Why be-ing, after all, and not rather no-thing?”

My Insights

Tonight, read starting at 156 of 294, 54. pg, 312-  Heidegger seems to be explaining the reason why there is a 'disconnect' between the 'instinct' and this something Other that he refers to as “conscience'. This seems to relate directly to Becker's interpretation of why humans can idealize and not act, or the constant guilt of not being able to be the 'Knight of Faith', the 'Uberman', which is a result of the 'divided-self', 'double-mindedness', etc.  There seems to be a 'calling' that does not seem to be me, but almost must be me.  It seems to go against what my 'natural-self' desires, but it seems to be the 'more-real' of the two phenomena.  This would explain why Heidegger could join the Nazi party.  This is why people 'slip up' or always seem to disappoint.  The most 'famous' man will be accused of something horrid, e.g. the priests, the CEO, the teacher, the writer, the philosopher, etc.  I need to explicitly make this connection between Heidegger and Becker; it was brought into my mind with such clarity before. It seems to be extremely hazy right now, but I am sure it will come back with a reading of Heidegger tonight.

Re-read 29., filled with great stuff.

Last paragraph on pg. 177, 88 of 294, 29.- Heidegger has a similar sentiment as Nietzsche with regards to science, Nietzsche used music as an example- even if science describes a symphony, mathematically, this says nothing about the lived experienced of hearing the music.  Heidegger mentions how science, looking at the world theoretically, has 'dimmed it down' and that 'moods', as with music and Nietzsche, still play a role in science; he further makes the point that this does not reduce science to pure 'feeling'.

12/5

After reading/listening to The Death of Ivan Illych, the illusion of everyone's actions around you is so transparent that it becomes an agony, i.e. 'hell is other people'.  It's impossible not to see through the actions of all, once they are seen once.

46-53 are very important on the 'everydayness' of the evasion of death.  Also important on the crucial aspect of anxiety which draws one away from the world, it's preconceived notions of culture, of 'they', and allows one to see one's true self: a nothingness.  The world is a nothing.  Yet, Heidegger asks if this anxiety-ridden existence is even possible, e.g. Nietzsche's breakdown says no, Kierkegaard's 'knight of faith' seems impossible/idealistic, Vivekananda's totally 'selfless' being also seems impossible, Becker agrees that these are not seemingly possible, even thought correct interpretations of the human condition and what is needed.  Anxiety opens discloses the Nothingness of all possibilities of everydayness and turns existence into an impossibility, i.e. Nihilism.  Where do we go from here?

Section 54., pg. 247, side-note 268 'begins' to answer this question. (133 of 253 on the pdf file)

Uncanniness = 'a nothing of the world', a 'not at home' feeling'.  The "Call of Conscious" = a voice both from with and yet seemingly from beyond ('alien voice') that tries to pull us away from the 'they' and back to our authentic/true Self, this 'voice' says nothing pragmatically, this voice in it's 'negation' is a 'positive', i.e. a path/revelation to our true selves, it is both 'us' and 'beyond us', i.e. Vivekananda's Oneness/Psychedelics.  Heidegger- 57.
