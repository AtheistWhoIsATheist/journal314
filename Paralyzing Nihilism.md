Carl Sagan also misunderstands the Moral Argument for God’s existence- _The Varieties of Scientific Experience_ pg. 159. And on pg. 162, Sagan says that people have “religious experiences” that lead them both _to and away_ from God! Of course! It’s the same experience, a different perspective/interpretation! Ha! If you mistakenly value the Earthly realm, suffering will most likely been seen as an “evil.” If you valued the only thing worth valuing, which is God, then you would not have this interpretation of suffering, or anything else in the Earthly realm, as “evil.”  As Jesus, Buddha, Socrates, Pascal, Spong, St. John of the Cross, Augustine, Fr. Seraphrim Rose, Molinos, Luther, Eckhart, Nietzsche (not his ridiculous response of a philosophy to Nihilism, but the actual experience which he misinterpreted),  Cioran, Ligotti, and on and on.  Hindu scriptures, Taoist scriptures,…  

Pg. 163- of course there are “molecules” that help us come closer to God, if God exists! That is rational and does make sense, but why is he so concerned with The Rational? Rationality must be circular or pragmatic in its justification. No? Why is God’s “justice” our justice? Why is human suffering, God’s suffering? This is too doctrinal.

Pg. 167 is drawing upon particular religious doctrines, again. These “objections” of what God could have done to make God known are drowned in Human/religious terms. Maybe these religious traditions are not all correct; well, obviously they aren’t. So, why ask such things of God as a “fire-cross in the sky”? Christianity may be flawed, as all religions necessarily are, because they are human, but this does not release the grandeur of God in everything else we see around us. That we _must_ see around us, in order for there to be any meaning, value, or purpose.

“With us, all men live not only without truth, not only without the least desire to know truth, but with the firm conviction that, among all useless occupations, the most useless is the endeavor to find the truth that governs human life.” Tolstoy

[Jul**27**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2016/07/27/727/ "July 27 2016")

It seems that there are different languages to describe the same situation.  For instance, the Nihilist and the theist are expressing the same ideas with the use of different language contexts.

“I think it is Max Müller who describes the amazement of an Indian convert to Christianity, who after absorbing the essence of the Christian doctrine came to Europe and saw the actual life of Christians. He could not recover from his astonishment at the complete contrast between the reality and what he had expected to find among Christian nations. If we feel no astonishment at the contrast between our convictions and our conduct, that is because the influences, tending to obscure the contrast, produce an effect upon us too. We need only look at our life from the point of view of that Indian, who understood Christianity in its true significance, without any compromises or concessions, we need but look at the savage brutalities of which our life is full, to be appalled at the contradictions in the midst of which we live often without observing them.”  Tolstoy  

“there is no doubt that healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best key to life’s significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth…The lunatic’s visions of horror are all drawn from the material of daily fact. Our civilization is founded on the shambles, and every individual existence goes out in a lonely spasm of helpless agony. If you protest, my friend, wait until you arrive there yourself.”  William James  

Ligotti seems to be speaking in a sort of theistic-worldview type language-“For the pessimist, everything considered in isolation from human suffering or any cognition that does not have as its motive the origins, nature, and elimination of human suffering is at base recreational, whether it takes the form of conceptual probing or physical action in the world— for example, delving into game theory or traveling in outer space, respectively. And by “human suffering,” the pessimist is not thinking of particular sufferings and their relief, but of suffering itself. Remedies may be discovered for certain diseases and sociopolitical barbarities may be amended. But these are only stopgaps. Human suffering will remain insoluble as long as human beings exist.”  Ligotti is couching his language in that of Nihilism, but he is saying nothing different than that of Jesus, Buddha, Socrates…  

People are confused, mis(un)guided, (some) unknowingly terrified about their existence and what it is they are to do in this absurd existence! Society and its culture inevitably crumbles into the contingency of history, family is annihilated and individualistic thinking that is not concerned with God and His perfection are demolished, the world is opened up into full union, material possessions are seen as the rust that they are, churches that are filled with ego driven, earthly-power hungry decreeing orders from ‘On High’, etc. True Nihilists are True Christians! Nihilists are true followers of Jesus, without being aware! Nihilism’s description of a worthless existence is correct! One infallible rule that Jesus taught: have no care for the earthly world! Jesus is a Nihilist! “My Kingdom is not of this world.” This is Nihilism! Jesus devalued the family, only in order to raise up the entire human race. A perfect example of what would “normally”, and mistakenly, be labeled as “selfish” is actually the proper mindset to have, if one follows Jesus, that is. It is not _either_ Nihilism or God, it is Nihilism _and_ God!

Psychiatry cannot be right! Of course you cannot cure what is true! Psychiatry would be the ultimate distraction! God needs to be the answer for Nihilism!

Now, where does Ligotti ground his ideas of “value”, i.e. for the concern of Suffering on his Nihilistic worldview? Well, of course he doesn’t have any grounding for this moral concern for suffering! And he admits this, graciously. But, this is because the Nihilist is one who has been drawn to the farthest, most terrifying, consequences that lay on the deepest edges of the naturalistic worldview!  The Nihilist _must_ discover/realize that their conclusions are the same exact conclusions as the theist!  The Nihilist needs to realize that his conclusions of the worthlessness of this existence, which entails the worthlessness of suffering, (since worldly suffering is not any sort of Ultimate concern for us) is the breakthrough of an awareness that shows that his Nihilism is one and the same path to God.  Be afraid of He who can destroy not just body, but body and soul. Human suffering, then, in fact does not get “devalued” entirely; human suffering is simply no longer _the_ end anymore. Suffering is not ignored, but rather dealt with in a different fashion. Instead of the elimination and “fighting” of evil, put in its place, is the acceptance of evil, the non-resistance of suffering!  This is how Jesus faced his own suffering and death! There are no causes to “eradicate” evil, there is an understanding which falls within the truth of God that is within a person. John **12:8** _“For the poor always ye have with you;_ but me ye have not always_.”_

“He must desire life like water and yet death like wine…**Christianity could not at once be the black mask on a white world, and also the white mask on a black world. The state of the Christian could not be at once so comfortable that he was a coward to cling to it, and so uncomfortable that he was a fool to stand it.”**  Chesterton

Luke 18:18-30

“And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’” And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.” When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, **“How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”** Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” But he said, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.” And Peter said, “See, we have left our homes and followed you.” And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.”  Luke 18:18-30

One must renounce life, in the fullest sense, i.e. family, material possessions, money, etc. God is all that is left…God is everything! Ha!  

“**But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap**. For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.” Luke 21:34-46  

John 18-19-  His kingdom is not of this world. Jesus says _nothing_ to Pilate, the one person who can help him, within this human realm.  Jesus remains silent due to Pilate’s impotence!  

Tolstoy seems to simply be discovering another message of Buddhism, of Socrates, of Schopenhauer, of Solomon, of Nihilism! This new discovery is the “true” character of Jesus. Do I believe Tolstoy because of his Nihilism, or is his perception of Jesus simply drowned out by the overwhelming experience of Nihilism? Is Tolstoy’s Jesus just a sketching out of his Nihilism in religious form/language? Or is Tolstoy’s interpretation, _due to_ his True experience of Nihilism, the fundamental, honest, and True way of understanding Jesus’ message? It seems to be the latter, even with it being the case that Jesus’ teachings aren’t _wholly_ unique.

Maybe Tolstoy is “misinterpreting” Jesus and the Gospel writings, for whatever reasons.  If this criticism of Tolstoy is correct, then it would seem that he is able to pull out of the Gospels whatever he likes, since whatever influence he may be under would take over the entire interpretation process. Nihilism Jesus! _**Either Tolstoy’s interpretation of Jesus is correct or his Nihilistic experience isn’t, since his Jesus is drowned in his own Nihilism!**_ One must be true in order for the other to be!  

Example- “It seems, then, that Jesus meant precisely what he said. We may declare the practice of such a rule to be very difficult; _**we may deny that he who follows it will find happiness**_; we may say with the unbelievers that Jesus was a dreamer, an idealist who propounded impracticable maxims; but it is impossible not to admit that he expressed in a manner at once clear and precise what he wished to say; that is, that according to his doctrine a man must not resist evil, and, consequently, that whoever adopts his doctrine will not resist evil. And yet neither believers nor unbelievers will admit this simple and clear interpretation of Jesus’ words.”

**“****_Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal._** For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.  The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, a but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!  No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. Y_ou cannot serve God and money_.”  Matthew 7  

Why do I feel guilty about trying to “better my life”? Well, of course!!!! It goes against what Jesus, Socrates, Buddha, etc. said!

“_**It might seem frightful to any one who does not realize the nothingness and absurdity of an isolated personal life, and who believes that he will never die. But I know that my life, considered in relation to my individual happiness, is, taken by itself, a stupendous farce, and that this meaningless existence will end in a stupid death.**_…**With us, all men live not only without truth, not only without the least desire to know truth, but with the firm conviction that, among all useless occupations, the most useless is the endeavor to find the truth that governs human life…**

**The only source of light for those who think and suffer is hidden. For a solution of the questions, What am I? what ought I to do? I am not allowed to depend upon the doctrine of him who came to save; I am told to obey the authorities, and believe in the Church. But why is life so full of evil? Why so much wrong-doing? May I not abstain from taking part therein? Is it impossible to lighten this heavy load that weighs me down? The reply is that this is impossible, that the desire to live well and to help others to live well is only a temptation of pride; that one thing is possible,—to save one’s soul for the future life….When such an instance does occur, it is not inspired by a desire to make life more simple, but to amass money and make it more sure. Each strives continually to make the heavy burden of existence still more heavy, by giving himself up body and soul to the practice of the doctrine of the world. To-day we must buy an overcoat and galoshes, to-morrow, a watch and chain; the next day we must install ourselves in an apartment with a sofa and a bronze lamp; then we must have carpets and velvet gowns; then a house, horses and carriages, paintings and decorations, and then—then we fall ill of overwork and die…**

With regard to work there is a difference between the doctrine of Jesus and the doctrine of the world. According to the doctrine of the world, it is very meritorious in a man to be willing to work; he is thereby enabled to enter into competition with others, and to demand wages proportionate to his qualifications. According to the doctrine of Jesus, labor is the inevitable condition of human life, and food is the inevitable consequence of labor.” Ha! Naturalists might agree with this interpretation of Jesus, some what. It seems that evolution has concerned us with food and survival…

We see enough of the frightful suffering endured by men in following the doctrine of the world, but in these times we hear nothing of suffering in behalf of the doctrine of Jesus. Thirty millions of men have perished in wars, fought in behalf of the doctrine of the world; thousands of millions of beings have perished, crushed by a social system organized on the principle of the doctrine of the world; **but where, in our day, shall we find a million, a thousand, a dozen, or a single one, who has died a cruel death, or has even suffered from hunger and cold, in behalf of the doctrine of Jesus? This fear of suffering is only a puerile excuse that proves how little we really know of Jesus’ doctrine. We not only do not follow it; we do not even take it seriously.**”  Tolstoy  

But, wait! This does not make sense! Why, then, does this world exist at all? Why was a world created for no reason but to escape it? Well, Tolstoy says that Jesus speaks of nothing but how to live in _this_ life. Of course, this spells out into some sort of mysterious union with God.  Jesus also said that the “heavenly” world was nothing like the worldly existence!  DMT.  It would seem that each person is on their own separate journey _with_ God.  This would  seemingly entail that morality is not what we “normally” take it to be. It would not be about suffering, or social injustice, nor hunger, nor poverty, etc. AS ENDS IN THEMSELVES! To attempt to extinguish any of these _earthly_ concerns, without God as the ultimate end or concern, is to lose morality all together. _Pray in the closet, not in front of others!_ A candle company that attempts to deal with social injustice? God is not concerned with social justice! Our cultural standards are not concerning God! Jesus’ ethical teachings do not require anything! Non-resistance to evil equates to non-movement! It allows for the contemplation and the appreciation of God! Everything else is a distraction! Bach (music, art, science, etc.) is still massively important when put in the context of discovering or experiencing God; for without God, Nihilism is the ultimate stopping point. Nihilism is both true and false! It is the correct interpretation, but not the stopping point! Tolstoy’s Nihilism is reflected so eloquently in his conception of Jesus. If he is wrong, then I am wrong. If Tolstoy is right, then I am right!

God is Nothing.

The Nihilist is privy to this idea of objectivity, which is why he is so close to God.

It seems to me, that to devalue this world is not wrong, it is the only thing to do. This world needs to be concerned with God. In order for Values, in order to experience God, to live the right way., one must devalue this world. In realizing the worthlessness of this world, the Greatness of God becomes clear; the only end worth anything is God. Material possessions, material work, a surplus of anything non-essential, a selfishness that is not involving the contemplation of God but of interests in earthly things is what needs to be erased. Open your eyes! No, open your minds and hearts! Pessimism grows stronger with the blindness of all others. Jesus, Socrates…

Speaking of Jesus, Tolstoy says: “There was, he said, one infallible rule, and that was to have no care about the worldly life.”

“I think it is Max Müller who describes the amazement of an Indian convert to Christianity, who after absorbing the essence of the Christian doctrine came to Europe and saw the actual life of Christians. He could not recover from his astonishment at the complete contrast between the reality and what he had expected to find among Christian nations. If we feel no astonishment at the contrast between our convictions and our conduct, that is because the influences, tending to obscure the contrast, produce an effect upon us too. We need only look at our life from the point of view of that Indian, who understood Christianity in its true significance, without any compromises or concessions, we need but look at the savage brutalities of which our life is full, to be appalled at the contradictions in the midst of which we live often without observing them.”  Tolstoy  

“And, at the present time, most men only imagine they profess Christianity and hold the Christian morality, but in reality they follow this family-State morality of paganism.”  Tolstoy  

The Question- Tolstoy and I have come to the same conclusions, from the same (Nihilistic) experience.  He has dressed his conclusions in the context of Christianity; I have not.  I have more in common with Jesus than I thought. But of course we should have thoughts in common, if we are all discovering the Truth.  The Truth is available to every and any one who wants to know it, Jesus says.  I agree. Come join me!

[Jun**27**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/27/526/ "June 27 2016")

Another misinterpretation- Pascal’s Wager! The wager itself, without any of the preliminaries, is always presented in a vacuum, absent of the Nihilistic experience that is described with such perfect detail, yet still so far from truly encapsulating the full experience of Nihilism. The experience of Nihilism is what makes Pascal’s Wager worth discussing. The Wager is not in a vacuum.  The experience of Nihilism is treated as the most infectious of diseases, and rightfully so.  

But why is this so?  Despair (which just is the Nihilistic experience) is pathetic, since it stems from an arbitrary emotion based on a blind, evolutionary process. Happy, sad, mad, scared, etc…all worthless instincts that the brain can bounce reality off of…maybe the other way around.

By objective, we must be talking about being able to discover the value of particular actions that do not allow all or every action to be meaningful or true. If everything can happen, then there cannot be any meaningful actions. And if there cannot be any meaningful actions, then there can be no morality. Without morality all human action is reduced to nonsensical movements and rants. Of course the thinker is not happy to find out that his thinking is a joke. But no bigger of a joke than anything else, since it’s all a joke.  

What’s the point of becoming aware of something that you can’t change? Or that you can’t do anything about? _WHAT IS THE POINT OF PHILOSOPHY?_ Oh, well, of course that’s the question put in plain English! The conclusion of philosophy seemingly has to be the experience of Nihilism. The Socratic Experience! Knowing that all human knowledge is Nothing!  Tolstoy would probably agree with this, although he would claim there is One thing more to all this.  I think he might be correct.

[May**26**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/521/ "May 26 2016")

The Apology- Socrates is misinterpreted. The optimism that ironically poisons humanity, that is _the_ roadblock for the _progress_ that so many, so ignorantly, preach of, is how Socrates’ words of “knowing Nothing” are unanimously taught (similarly, Pascal’s Wager always gets reduced to a sort of parlor trick, which misses the entire purpose of his wager: the nightmare of existence).  The one thing that Socrates knows is that he knows Nothing! Humility at its finest? No! Nihilism! The interpretation that takes knowing Nothing as a simple state of ignorance, while partially correct, misses the most important aspect of Socrates’ declaration! The Nihilistic experience is what Socrates embodies! Not some arbitrary _human_ value such as “humility”! The awareness of his ignorance is not a cause for celebration or for imitation. It’s not that he knows nothing, it’s that his knowledge, _all human knowledge_, is _worth_ Nothing! There is no humility, there is only the crushing realization of the illusions that are human thought! Of course others know more than him in particular Human discourses (they know way more than me) but they don’t experience the Nothingness of their knowledge.  This is why Socrates, and anyone who has experienced the Nothingness of Nihilism, is “superior”. Ha!  

Nietzsche was right to criticize Plato/Socrates for their devaluation of _this_ world. The Other world is the “philosophy”, it is the “pursuit”, of Socrates! Socrates had _hope_ for such an Other world, and therefore was only a Pessimist and not a Nihilist! Socrates’ experience is the same as mine, yet his disposition is one of hopeful pessimism rather than despairing Nihilism. _This may be the difference between Pessimism and Nihilism!_

The idea that a man who ignored his wife and kids, disrupted all the people around him with his questions, who devalued all opinions including his own…to be seen as an optimist, a person of humility, a person of emulation! Ha! This misses the point! Socrates, as he says, is just the figure for the Nothingness of human knowledge. It’s not that if you question enough, and if you keep an “open” mind, and stay positive you will obtain some knowledge that is beneficial, that is an end, or _the_ end. Rather, the end is Nihilism. The end is the Nothingness of human knowledge. After reaching this point, after wiping the slate clean, then we can discuss God and the other world. For, if we do not, then we are forced to discuss simple nothing, rather than Divine Nothing. We will be living an illusion, speaking of phantoms, instead of pursuing _the_ End. We will be missing the forest through the trees. _This_ is the life of the philosopher, as Socrates rightfully pointed out. However, this “pessimistic” view is not taught as a valid interpretation of Socrates’ views. It seems to be the only interpretation, however!  

This alienation or “experience” that Socrates speaks of in the Apology and which Plato discusses in his allegory of the cave are the same exact experience- Nothingness! To dismiss Nihilism as a result, or  
as a “false” consequence, of Christianity is therefore wrong. Nihilism can be separated from its Christian (mis)interpretations! Nihilism’s roots predate Christianity! The _need_ for the Other world is the cause of Nihilism, but this is not strictly Christianity. The pessimistic attitude of the Greeks, that is superficially wrapped in optimism, only stems from an ignorance concerning God and His existence, and the full grasp of the conclusions of Nihilism!

No, this is not right. Socrates was right- we do not know the outcome of death, so we cannot despise death! But we can despise life and its Nothingness! Death is not the enemy of the philosopher! Then, what to make of this life? Nietzsche was right in his response to _this_ sort of “nihilism”, as mistaken as he was in the details. This life is worthless, meaningless, nothing. Then, we do not need to “build up” this world into another “great” illusion, separate from the “common” illusions, we need to _hope_ for the other world that Socrates mentions/argues for. Until then, we must discuss the issues, we must do philosophy. But, it is philosophy concerned with God. The ultimate questions all come back to God (knowledge, existence, morality, etc.), so the discussion of other philosophical concepts must be had, but only in their relation to this God and this other world, never for our human sake. Science is empty if it regards existence as purely natural.  There isn’t anything in this world that can ever be propped up into anything more than an illusion.

Human knowledge must be for some end. Ironically enough, it cannot be for our human end. Strange. But, what else is new? Truth is gone. Morality is gone. Paradoxes of reason are here to stay, they are a part of the limited “reason” we Westerners maintain is so powerful! Strong and weak is the human mind. Perceiving the world (whatever that means) even with all its paradoxes!

Reading is good. Writing is better. Thinking is best. Not rational thinking. Free thinking. Anything goes, anything is allowed, because all is questioned! Why pursue Truth? For what end? No ultimate end? If that’s all you have to offer me, then fine, you win. But keep your knowledge, it is not for me. I have no concern for intrinsic values in a valueless universe! Preach to someone else. Take your inflated ego and push your hot air into the face of another!  

It’s not that Socrates knows nothing, it’s that there is nothing to know! Worthless human knowledge! “Worthless”- value-ridden. The definition of worthless in non-moral terms- worthless equals all knowledge being true and false at the same time! Dialetheism!

But this world must be _something,_ if it is in relation (whether through its creation, or maybe by some sort of ultimate reality that is beyond, but not directly related to, the empirical world) to so ultimate being. Why would human knowledge be worth Nothing if there were some purpose to this existence? Is this existence a personal hell that each must pass through in order to reach this other realm? If so, then this is not a world to be valued, it is a world to be “worked” through with a sort of pessimistic attitude. If this existence is truly for nothing, and everything is Nothing, then existence becomes a nightmare.

Again- the main question is how a Meaningful world, a meaningful existence, could comprise of our knowledge equating to Nothing in relation to this sort of ultimate reality? For what end? For hope? How do we spend our time? Nothingness and chaos or Hope and experience?

[May**26**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/514/ "May 26 2016")

Solutions to my problem- what are they?

Nihilism cannot be written about. Footnotes, sources, references…all nonsense! What’s the difference between an academic, “polished” work and a first-draft? What’s the difference between digging through the convoluted, pretentious language of a “scholar” and working through the authors ideas as he first conceives them? What’s the difference between the “finished” product and the actual, first-hand progression of an author’s thoughts? Which ought we to prefer? I want the notes. I want the scribblings. I want to “see” the author dissect his own thoughts in a way that is not meant to “impress”. I want to learn, as the author does when he first puts pen to paper!

Francious Laruelle- An entire life’s work with no audience! How do you get through the day without feeling pathetic?  I feel pathetic.

I still don’t have any courage. While I can see Zarathustra in what seem to be full glimpses- I can feel him, smell him…I am only an imitation still.

“…finally it called its despair, its omnipotence ‘God’.” Nietzsche

“Nihilism might be a _divine_ way of thinking.” But he says this in regards to humans being able to survive in the face of nihilism, which he himself could not do. Maybe I am right, that Nihilism is _truly_ Divine in that the negation of every value comes to a Perfect value of that in God.

“we must experience nihilism before we can find out what value these values really had.”

None of the advice, none of the “answers” are correct. There are no answers. We do not know why we are here. So, how do we choose a path, if that path that we do in fact choose may be wrong, and therefore lead us farther away from the Truth and the right path? If there is no “right path”, then we are Nihilists. Truth cannot exist in a meaningful world!  Truth as a concept leads to insolvable disagreements.  A great contradiction!  Reason is too weak to make ultimate decisions, at least all on its own.  

The atheist demolishes any ontological grounding for the most important aspects of Humanity, then proceeds on into the mindless void. Aren’t we supposed to build on stone? Isn’t it fools who build on sand? The Psalmist may have been right about what he said about the atheist!  

Enlightened, Nihilistic, Religious, Skeptic…all these descriptions, and more, _can_ be the exact same position. What determines how you label yourself with a particular description is your attitude in response to the position. Otherwise, there is an umbrella of beliefs that the Religious, like the Nihilistic, like the Skeptic, all adhere to. In other words, there is no intellectual dispute here, there is an emotional dispute. Upbringing, genetics, learning, social and cultural barriers, etc. all play a part in the choosing of this “intellectual” matter.

“Those who make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.” Blackburn quotes Voltaire like it matters, how cute. As an atheist, Blackburn’s language, or logic, can not make sense of the word “atrocity”. This is a word that cannot exist, in the sort of way that Blackburn assumes it to exist, which is in a real, ontological sort of existence which is only allotted for by the existence of objective moral values. Blackburn’s concern is downright silly. Almost as funny as his statement that “Truth has rights and privileges of its own.” Ha!

Blackburn actually states that a Wittgenstein’s faith does not “…escape _ethical_ criticism.” Ha! I love it! You have not _felt_ your own worldview. There is an utter lack of the Nihilistic experience.

Saint Cecilia was sentenced to death by suffocation in her own bath house…she lived. An effort to behead her then came in response to her living. Three attempts at her head were taken. She, again, lived. She died three days later from her wounds, singing all the time songs of praise for God.

And you say I take things too seriously?

Maybe my Meaning is to be the Patron Saint of Pessimism! Nah, too much. Ha!

There does seem to be _something_ missing from my Nihilism. This is keeping my curiosity as of late.

My confidence is never fully there like I wish it was. Can you really blame me though? What a strange world, where the same proposition can be taken as being one of the most fundamental of questions that a human being can ask themselves, while at the same time also being accepted as the epitome of triviality. What kind of world is _that_? What kind of existence involves Meaningful beings who, concerning the same belief, both give their lives _and_ reject its content out of hand?  Sounds like an idiot species to me.  

This is supposed to be my last work, not my first! I am writing backwards! Ha!

“Nietzsche claimed he had suffered through the sickness of Schopenhauer’s “romantic pessimism” and overcame it by turning his own will to health into a philosophy of life, one strong enough to embrace life, despite the fact that life is essentially suffering. So in opposition to Schopenhauer, Nietzsche claimed that his philosophy was a **pessimism of strength**, a world view that said _yes to life_ in full consciousness of what is terrible and questionable about existence, doing so in full consciousness of all the miserable, evil, ugly, and absurd. Thus Nietzsche viewed his “Dionysian” perspective as saying “yes” to life in contrast to Schopenhauer’s “no’.”

And _this_ is why Nietzsche “went mad”.  No one can live, _alone_, with the experience of Nothingness.   Nietzsche, the person, was a Nihilist.  His writings, while they reflect his true Nihilism, they are also riddled with the false hope that he himself couldn’t believe in order to stay “sane”.  Only his writings are nihilistic.

I am too worried about what others are thinking and not what I am thinking. What am I thinking?

I do not need to read the followers of a false God, I need the God of Nihilism! The God that scared Pascal into believing a false god! The God that sent Nietzsche into a self-induced, counterfeit “madness” is the God that I seek! The God that kept William James from walking out into the dark night alone, for multiple years, is the God I know! _Maybe_ this is the God of Kierkegaard; and if it is, then I am at fault for misinterpreting his Nihilism. Maybe it doesn’t matter if you believe in God or not. God and Nothingness are the exact same thing. Nothing is God! To believe in Nothing is to be as close to God as you can be in this form. Your religion is false because your God is not the greatest conceivable being! The greatest conceivable being is the Being who is God and Nothingness, as one. Any religion that does not teach that God is Nothingness, who does not declare Him to be both everything and nothing, at the very same time, only brings one away from the True God.

Arguments, proofs, emotion, need, crisis, unquenchable existential desires…Nothingness!

Science is interesting, but it is not as interesting as attempting to open up the infinite void of Nothingness that is our consciousness. The idea of a psychedelic experience opens up another state of Being seemingly ought to be Humanities top priority. Why are we voluntarily trapping ourselves in _this_ form of consciousness? Don’t be so scared.

Of course a substance may make you seem stupid from the outside spectator. Consciousness was not set up to make toast when under the influence of a God-inducing substance. Sit, do nothing. Do not socialize. Do not move. Sit, think. Do no Human acts.

The “darkness” of the Divine. A pessimist isn’t a failed mystic, they are the True Mystics!

What if mystics are simply mistaken Nihilists?! Another interpretation. It is all or nothing! God or Nothingness!

Meister Eckhart, for shame! Anyone who speaks with confidence is to be shunned! To put forth propositions as knowledge or Truth, and not as mere opinion, or better yet, as pure _discovery_ of Truth with (of course) indestructible hints of doubt…To speak with confidence is to speak contrary to an incomprehensible God! God is Nothing, you cannot speak of what to do about Nothing. The only tone appropriate for speaking about God is one of self-doubt. Anything more would be to understand the incomprehensible.

Faith vs Reason- Atheism, champion of Reason, only makes sense under a theistic worldview. Progress only makes sense under a theistic worldview. Without God, there is no knowledge. Without knowledge, pragmatism reigns supreme. Put crudely, anything goes. The Atheist cannot be as smart as he thinks he is, if he argues for a concept (truth) that can only make sense, or only matters, under the negation of his worldview. Faith, instead of being the grand enemy of reason, is now something either mysterious and enlightening (in too many ways to explain) or it is one of the many arbitrary, all equally worthless, human interpretations of the nightmare of existence. Either way, whether in Truth or in Need, faith does not seem to be the enemy of any man.  Truth matters only on Theism.  Need of belief on atheism is justified, since every belief is justified on Nihilism. Faith becomes the enemy of man when faith leads to incorrect conceptions of this God or that Doctrine, but, again, this is only a care for the theist (the holder to objective truth), not the atheist; the atheist has no voice in this world unless his position is itself, ironically, false.  If the atheist objects to faith, then he must do so properly and openly, out of pragmatic, arbitrary, self-concern that has no ontological grounding in reality outside his own mind. Atheism is self-refuting. Atheism is Nihilism. Nihilism is unlivable.

The experience of what my father must have felt, or ought to have felt, is indescribable.  His complete loss of self.  Your petty world, this pathetic world, is nothing but these losses, over and over again, until the last human drops. This experience of Nothing is the reason to continue living, yet it is also the same reason to pursue your death.

How do I experience God? Am I bringing on my experience of Nothingness? Maybe. Could I bring on, or maybe a better way to put it would be for me to “embrace”, perfection/mystery?

How do I embrace God and escape the Nothingness?

Is the complete absence of God, and the experience of Nothingness, an indirect (direct?) way of experiencing God? Something _must be,_ for these experiences to exist.

Plato’s Cave is an allegory about the relationship between Truth-seekers and “normal” people, who are stuck in their tradition, culture, etc. Of course the Truth-seeker, when he comes back from outside the cave is speaking “nonsense”, you cannot make sense of something you have not personally experienced! Experience Nothingness, then tell me it’s nonsense, tell me it’s “psychotic”.  Everyone is in the cave! Come out of the darkness and play with me in the Nothingness!  

Eugene Thacker- “There is a sense in which pessimists are just failed mystics.”

Rather, there is a sense in which mystics are simply confused Nihilists!  It is all or nothing!  Purpose or no purpose.  Meaning or no meaning.  Value or no value.  God _or_ Nothingness!  

The Ultimate Contradiction- Nihilism is _a_ proper way to believe in God!  God is Nothingness because He is everything!  To be everything is to be Nothingness.  Nothingness is the negation of God, yet the full embodiment of Him.  The Nihilistic experience _just is_ the mystical experience!  The Nihilistic experience shows me what it is like to be a finite being face to face with the Infinite.  The despair of Nothingness simply _is_ God!  This would explain why God, Perfect Nothingness, the ultimate contradiction, would produce so much variety, so much confusion, so many different experiences of Him in _this_ world, Nothingness just being one of an infinite ways of possible exposures. What an incredible sort of Being.

Ultra-rational- contradictions are made rational.

I hope you feel the Nothingness that was my life. This _is_ a suicide note. Who am I kidding? I don’t have the courage. I hope that this song tears you apart. I hope it melts your insides. I hope you feel even the smallest bit of what I feel. I stand at my death with great magnificence! I will thank Jesus in eternity. You may thank him now…for whatever it is you’re feeling right this moment. Thank Jesus for this experience. This feeling must be absurd for you…

To the people who declare “Just kill yourself already!” Is my suffering too much for you? My apologies.

Adventurous mystery or paralyzing nightmare?

Oh, I must walk the dog now, excuse me, just for a second. Hallelujah!

This must be the full collapse. Could there possibly be anymore than this? I cannot imagine… The originator of my Nothingness is more cruel and pernicious than any torturer or executioner in the short history of homo sapiens. You tease me. You tease me! You don’t let me believe! You never let me! Frozen. Stuck.

Thank you! If you were only real… How do you allow me to experience Nothing so sincerely. It trumps you! You are second only to Nothing. You tremble in the presence of Nothing!

I want you to understand me. Why doesn’t anyone understand me? I am no Alien.

Close your eyes, if you are under a “normal” consciousness. Every note is not only heard, but felt. It almost rips you apart.  “Funeral”.

There are people who haven’t heard about Christianity yet? Fuck that, some people haven’t heard Bach! Even Bach is nothing! How about A. Scarlatti? Hmm? Just a lot of fluff and technique without any song writing abilities? Maybe, I am not sure. Bach is everything? Bach is Nothing.

Do this. Do that. Then die. Fantastic! On with it now?

Blistering at first. _Almost_ melodic. Then the evil comes in. Enough to give you chills. It grows in the pit of your stomach, enough to pull your face into the slightest grimace, only to bring you strangely, discordantly, back into the melody.

I cannot even begin to express the feelings of existence that are trapped within my mind.  Why does the experience of Nihilism evaporate into thin air as soon as the words I use to describe it leave my mouth?  I may as well not say a word.  A “vow of silence” never made more sense.  

All the boundaries have collapsed. I am left to rebuild…but I do not want to rebuild anything. I wish I had courage, since it would lead me out of _this…_one way or another.

Everything has crumbled. A living nightmare. Conceptually, existence seems like it could have many different interpretations. However, once you leave your desk, and enter into reality, you realize it can only be one way…Nothing.

The Nothingness that I experience makes me feel like I am walking around with the heaviest armor suit that one could possibly imagine. I see robots. I see confusion. I see vanity. I see Nothing. I want God. I want GOD!

The experience of an “afterlife” brought with it an almost unending amount of dread. Existence, whatever it is, officially becomes a nightmare when the “savior” of an afterlife becomes a thing of anxiety.

“Coping” is the most laborious of terms. When life is reduced to “coping”, when “coping” is seen as a savior…_this_ is the unseen nightmare. How do the vast majority of humans not see what I see?

Come into my brain for just a tiny bit and you will realize how “silly” I am being. Just you wait. I hope you experience the Nothingness. If you don’t, then you have not lived a life worth anything, which is ironically what you think life is: Value!

Writing like a madman is fun. Ha! It is a freedom like no other. I will only write from now on. I do not want to speak at all. Speaking is worthless. You don’t understand my voice, you won’t understand my words…

Courage to die. The fight between my mind and my instincts is peculiar. Who do I want to win? It seems that if consciousness is an accident, then the instincts that guided their way, through the millions, even billions of years, into my body have done a pretty good job and I ought to allow them to win. But if they win, my suffering continues. MY SUFFERING- pathetic. I am just a “psychotic”. All these things, sure. Whatever you want to call me is fine. You’re too dumb to understand how dumb you are. Your criticism of me is not worth the air you breathe.

“Why do you do anything then?” Ha! The Ultimate “Gotcha!” I never thought of _that_ before. You know what? You’re right, the nightmare is over! I didn’t realize that I was self-contradictory! Oh, no, wait, actually I have. I also understand that you are still assuming a Meaningful logic that entails ideas about “rationality”. Making “sense” is overrated. No, it’s impossible!

I feel utterly alone in my madness. My alienation is overwhelming. I hate you for making it worse. Small-brained imbecile.

No courage, too bad.

What makes Cioran special in your eyes? What does he know that I do not know? I don’t think he knows anything. I have yet to meet another person who is smarter than me.

Existence is only a gift, and not a nightmare, when we are not living in the real world.

Your anger towards my despair may be the funniest joke a human can tell.  Your interpretations of “love” and “compassion” are not only “worthless” on my view, but they are most definitely Worthless on yours.

There is no savior. This world is not worth living in. Anyone who says anything differently is delusional. There is no “reality”. There is no “normal”. There is _this._ There is murder. There is suffering. There are humans sitting in a room thinking about “existence” as if their perception of reality makes any difference to the gruesome madness that is going on around us. I do not want to type. My words do not capture my thoughts. My words do not capture reality as I see it. Of course you can write a book, with much vigor too! But only because you do not think that your thoughts, your contributions, are in vain! Oh, but, they are all in vain!

I haven’t written anything for a while. I have lost almost all passion. I am no longer _feeling_ much of anything, yet I feel overwhelmed with and by every thing. Very strange, but what’s new? This is a ride, for sure. I feel alone. I want to be alone because that feels the most natural to me.

I can finally read Nietzsche. It’s a miracle! He has always bored me. He never “grabbed” me like Cioran or other Nihilists. Instead, he put me to sleep. Last night was different. I am Zarathustra! No, I am not. I am too weak. I am too scared. I am too cowardly. Maybe one day!

There is a difference between speaking of an idea and preaching the Truth. Everyone has been told to preach the truth (not Truth), to fain confidence in the face of ultimate skepticism. Silly. Fake.

I am Zarathustra! I am not crazy, I have developed my own values! Develop yours and have them disagree with mine, this will be inevitable; but do not accept Traditional, Lame, Disgusting values.

My thoughts are all over the place. Why must I harness my words, for _you_ to understand?

Words are just words, sounds are just sounds, happiness is just happiness…all the same, all Nothing.

They could be wrong, yet I could be wrong. We could both be wrong. But if they all are wrong, then Nihilism seems the most obvious. What about psychedelics? Could they be my Savior?

I am not sure what sort of writing is “good” or “entertaining”. Well, there obviously isn’t any objective criterion for writing, it depends on the audience. Lovecraft is great…to me! Ha!

It seems that the “spiritual world” is not concerned with morality due to it’s incorporeal nature. If morality is just a Human invention, then all religions that emphasize Morality are necessarily negated as Truth.

I want to write…maybe one day someone will respond. Maybe I will have a conversation worth having. I doubt it though.

I feel more important than most people. I am special. Maybe I don’t want Education, I want friendship and conversation. Maybe not.

I don’t have anything to say tonight. I am not thinking much. I want to learn…constantly. I want my brain to leak full of knowledge.

Mathematics is the language which humans are seemingly forced to use in order to describe the universe.

Ha! I do not need to make sense? Your perception will fill in whatever it wants to fill in!

I want to be talked about. I have not met anyone as interesting as me. I have met people who have retained more “facts” about this or that thing or subject, but I have not met anyone like me before! Self-deprecation is good! Self-deprecation is bad! Confidence is good! Confidence is bad! Leave me be! I will be me, whoever that is…it’s most likely Nothing!

I do not agree with much of what I have written in the last month or so. I feel that I am constantly “refining” my thoughts. I am not sure what to make of this “change” in thoughts.

Every action has a stupid perspective. No matter what one says or does, one can be perceived as pathetic, stupid, genius, mad, talentless, God-like, etc……all at the same time.

Talk about “creating my reality” for me. You acted exactly as I predicted. While we are all contradictory beings, at least we are the ones who are aware that we are contradictions.

Of course Nihilism is only a transitional stage for Nietzsche; his philosophy is for the living. Nihilism is a _living_ philosophy for the dead, not a philosophy that is _lived._ It is the only part of the Nihilist that is alive (whatever “alive” even means).

Tonight has been an onslaught of experiences. Existence is a nightmare, plain and simple. The first “American” (whatever that stupid fucking label is even supposed to mean) to meet a “god” with nuclear weapons that could help bring the human race to an even faster conclusion was…Dennis Rodman. This “god” enjoys basketball…

You cannot change any paradigm of ideas, not because it isn’t wrong, but because no paradigm of ideas can be right. Argument is useless. Philosophy is useless. A great waste of time. Ironic that philosophy can introduce Nihilism to a person, but not _every_ person.

What no one can understand is that it is all Nothing. Your judgment, your reaction…worthless. I will hang up the phone without even a breath. The silence as I hang up the phone will be the last sound of mine that you will have to force yourself to imagine that you heard.

The nightmare must end, but on my terms. I am afraid of boredom. There is no such thing as boredom. Cheap, simple living. Eliminate everything, then eliminate myself. I do not want to see myself rot. There is no enjoyment in rotting.

Will my degree bring with it credibility? No, of course it won’t.

Manic-depressive- the most fantastic combination of states to be in.

Nothing means what it is supposed to mean. To have a conversation with a “successful” man and to hold every word of his in the utmost contempt…something is not right here. I need out of this mess.

I have a disconnection from almost everything that exists. I understand it all. I do not need a “ms-reading” due to a _useless_ Meaningful logic. I cannot, no, I do not even want to express myself.

An ever-growing amount of music…it seems, almost, infinite. And I get drawn back to Bach, every time.

I think Cioran is perfect, but not at all. I think Ligotti sums up everything in a beyond-powerful sort of way, yet something is missing. I want the journals of these psychopaths. I don’t want a depressing tale about their thoughts, I want their depressing thoughts, in their solitude.

Strange, people seems to need “evidence” for the link between “mental disorders” and “creativity”. The definition of “creativity” is to think/act/create “outside the box”. Someone has a “mental disorder” when they exhibit thoughts/acts “outside the box” of “normal” human behavior. What’s the skepticism all about?

I see the difference in myself and my writing, when I am in that moment of ecstasy, Nothing, manic…

I do not want to be writing “philosophy” or “poetry” or even “journals”. I will put the “period” where I want to put the “period”. See? Ha!

How could it be that most people have taken, what I see as the most important, if not, at least the most intense, experiences a human being can have, and demonized and attempted a sort of “genocide of thought”?

Perspectives. All we have. Initially, Ultimately freeing; after a closer look, utterly damning. I have _my_, arbitrary, worthless, no better off, perspective. It’s mine, yet not even mine. It’s Nothing.

In my most “confused” states is where I feel the most free, the most _me!_

What is anyone putting out anything for? Why are writers writing? Why are painters painting? No, not for themselves, since they would never need to show another person anything they had created solely for themselves. Maybe I will never show this to anyone. Maybe I will show this to whoever will look at it.

I do not need any thing or any one besides myself. This is for me, and only me. It’s not that I am meeting or surrounding myself with the wrong people, it’s that these people even exist in the first place. Further, they exist in abundance: they are everywhere! These people who are too stupid to get out of their own way. Of course, I am interesting! But only because you are the definition of boring! For you idiots, it’s like the broke, homeless man telling you that you are rich, when he sees you pull a twenty dollar bill from your pocket. You are not _even_ broke; you are in debt. And still, he thinks you’re rich. Well, that’s how I am interesting; only at the dispense of your mediocrity. I wish everyone who was worthless would kill themselves. Who is “worthless”? Fuck off, you know, you know all too well.

Life has gotten weird to the people who do not understand me. I feel bad for you, that you do not understand. _What a bland existence._

Who’s worse: The Suit or The Slut? Both are pathetic for the complete opposite reasons. One is thinking too much, the other has never thought a second in her life. What are we to make of this? Who’s living the way they ought to live? No one, obviously. That’s what is so hilarious, yet horrific.

_These_ thoughts are everything and nothing. Important, profound, pathetic, worthless.

This is _a_ life. What a life…a life of Nothing.

Do you want to read this? Too scared? Too boring? Either way…you’re right! Ha! Perspective, right? You don’t know how distressing that cliché really is. I hate you for not understanding how grotesque that cliché is.

I hope you meet disaster tomorrow night. I hope you crumble too. I would hate to see you be competent.

I don’t want you to understand a word. But I do want you to believe that you understand every word. I want you to experience every word like it was a word of your own. You don’t get it though, let’s make this crystal clear.

Piano, Harpsichord, or Church Organ? Listen to all three versions, then pick a favorite. I have a favorite…but I won’t tell you. Let this arbitrary, useless fact haunt you for the rest of your life.

The altering of perception _is_ the altering of reality. This should show us how arbitrary the “normal” state of consciousness really is.

Listen to Handel or Bach, some piece that you have never listened to before, and try to predict the next note within a piece that is heavy in counterpoint technique. It feels as if you are on the first drop of a roller-coaster. The nausea in the pit of your stomach is exactly the same!

Scientific explanations are funny. “This is how this happened…” Well, of course it happened, because we are here. _Why_ did _this_ happen?

Why are academics regurgitators of minds past? I don’t care how “Anselm” would have answered the question. You’re wracking your brain in a scramble to speak intelligently about God’s Goodness? What a great scholar you are!  Divine Goodness doesn’t seem to make sense. I can see it in your eyes. Not only did you look confused, you let out a hint of fear. “Goodness” is a garbage concept.

The biggest absurdity comes from talk of the Human realm and the demand that God _must_ relate to it in some way. Put yourself into the mind of an imbecile…God instantly disappears. Contemplate the Infinite…the Human world dissipates just as quickly.

In order to get to the discovery of Nothing, you must do _something._

Philosophy…what else is there to do?

I _need_ to eliminate the need for approval of others. I need to enter isolation holding my own hand.

Systematic thinking is tiresome. People are talking about nothing. Am I becoming anti-intellectual or transforming into a Super-intellectual?

I need to do whatever it is that _I_ need to do. Painful or not, I must do something which might turn out to be nothing.

One cannot be an expert on everything, yet they can be sufficiently (whatever that means) informed. Why do I want to be “sufficiently informed?” I want to know to know.

It’s not that I do not want to hear what others have to say, it’s that when I hear other people speak, they are not telling me what _they_ believe, but are rather they are speaking to me in cliché redundancies. Utterly uninteresting.

The _very few_ who help me expand my thoughts, you are my Gods.

I do not need an interpreter, I can understand your paradoxical speech quite clearly.

Are these simply “notes”, or is this the work?

Why pronounce vapid conclusions when you can ask profound questions? God is the Nothing! Is God the perfect relation to the Nothing?  The latter seems much better to me.

I want to escape into knowledge at the speed of light, yet I want to retreat into Nothing in the slowest-fast pace one cannot imagine.

It’s strange that I cannot bring on my sense of anxiety, nor my normal sense of panic…I wonder what is happening to me. I feel that I am still understanding, but not so much. Very strange.

It is strange, the sort of mind that can compile a 500 page work of philosophy. As Infinite as things are, that’s still too many pages. Say what you need to say, right _now._

Every piece of writing is a perfect thought. Of course I can never reproduce perfection…but I can.

That’s the problem, to turn my thoughts into work! My thoughts are for my destiny, not my livelihood!

Philosophy and Classical music. There are too many words, as there are too many notes, and not enough time!

No one has anything to say. Listen to a person speak, you can learn a lot more from their silence.

I am the Better Buddha! I don’t search for Nothing in order to release my suffering, I _trap_ the Nothing in order to revel _in_ my suffering! Life is not suffering to be avoided, life is suffering to be achieved!

Death is here. You are never _fully_ in control of even one moment of your entire life.

My mind has been empty. I have been calm. It’s strange. I am not as calm as the normal person, yet I have not felt any panic for a long while. I feel that life is not worth anything if I cannot experience the raptures of Nihilism. Nihilism is my God. Nihilism is God.

We deceive ourselves into thinking that if we could go back in time to meet our idols that they would be the first person that we have ever met that is not disgusting and awful.

Cioran mentions the grotesqueness of humans, yet does not _completely_ renounce them. _This_ is his flaw! As powerful and complete as _On the Heights of Despair_ in fact is, it is not Perfection!

I need to get lost in my thoughts.

Ah! I see a world of human bodies, scampering around confused, yet confident, all with their own little, black cloud of death hovering over their heads. “What a Meaningful life!”, shouted the man who’s heart only seconds later unknowingly delivered him into Nothingness. He’s already a memory.

With my words, I wish to invoke _something._ I want to be asked questions and taken seriously, even though what I think is never what I say. I will be thinking about why I am saying _this_, when I am clearly and definitively saying _that_ in my head. In the middle of my words, there is a frustration that is building within my inner, conscious mind. _This_ inner dialogue is what is missing from people with confidence; they lack an awareness. An extra-sensory awareness.

The boredom surrounding my own thoughts is extremely frustrating. I don’t even want to do _this._

If I think it to myself, why is this not enough? I have thought it. Who else needs to know? No one. Write what you write. This _is_ freedom! I want the open canvas! I can now freely paint! I wish to express my experience without explaining it! Do you understand me? No, of course you don’t. It is not an understanding of the mind, but an _eruption_ of the inner spirit. Like a broken dam, it comes pouring out.

I don’t want to teach, because I don’t want to speak. If I could speak with my eyes, I would cut out my vocal chords right this moment.

Progressive movements are nonsensical.

I need to be able to read, think, and listen all at the same time.

When other people think that others are full of “wisdom”, is it because they are hearing something knew or are they simply agreeing with the words that describe an already present belief?

Religions without God, without immortality, were always dismissed as worthless. However, once you realize that everything is _worthless,_ particular eastern religions become much more interesting.

Maybe I should analyze Cioran? Would this be worth something?

I cannot even listen to anything for more than a few seconds. Calmness is _not_ inspiring.

Is my enlightenment simply my stupidity? Am I learning or simply becoming aware? _This_ is the new experience!

I have found another flaw! This time in Heisman! He spent five years developing his writing, it was his Work! Ha! Silly. The bravest act in human history is a _silent suicide_. The act speaks louder than any words could even dream to encompass. The confusion, pain, and hopefully terror, would be all that needs to be put across. Unfortunately, these experiences are not necessary consequences of _the_ act, which in turn negates the act. Now one cannot even commit suicide as an act of defiance. _The blind man can stare into the sun all day long. Humans can swim in the sea of the absurd and never drown._ I understand why, and I hate it.

The intoxicated man is the most interesting man, as long as he is by himself.

When one can no longer distinguish between physical and dream, sadness and boredom, happiness and delusion…then we are empty. We are Nothing. I wonder how long we can last as Nothing…

I crave to be a leader, but know that I am destined to follow.

As incredible as Bach is, his melodies are nothing God-like or God-inspiring. While Bach was the master of creating melodies with two hands and two feet, God as an incorporeal being would produce an infinite melody that would most certainly kill a human if even one “note” was heard by the human ear.

The most profound questions stem from the most basic observations. Philosophy is _the_ pig dressed up in a suit. The ostracization of the philosophical community is an abomination that would have Socrates rolling in his grave. These most basic experiences, that are the catalyst to an infinite amount of speculation, need to be roped back into the simple experiences of what it means to be a human being. What this sort of basic-infinitude style of reasoning may produce I do not know, but it cannot be any worse than what we see today.

I want my last breath to be the same breath that is stolen from me when I fully experience Bach. As insignificant as this brilliant piece of music is, with it’s illusory nature of omnipotence, which seemingly screams from containment within even the most advanced architecture of man, only goes to show how lowly even the greatest of Human achievements are when placed on the backdrop of the universe. _This_ realization of Humanity makes existence worth all of the effort.

Within the panicked tragedy of subjectivity, there emerges a calm sense of being that washes away the absurdities, yet only within the impractical confines of solitude.

If Humans _are_ fundamentally part of the universe, then what sense can be made of the unravellings of human “invention?”

The difference between Nihilism and Buddhism is that Nihilism is not a coward. The mental suffering of Nihilism must be revered in order to be swallowed up by the Nothing. Buddhism attempts to eliminate this mental suffering, as if for some other end. The _only_ end is the suffering of the Nothingness.

You do not dare try to lecture, ridicule, or patronize the man who has set his body ablaze and lived to tell about it, simply because you burnt the tip of your finger on the stove-top that one time.

Of course I cannot contribute anything, except the analysis of my mind. Although this is worthless too, this is the only that can actually be done with any sort of authenticity.

The definition of Naivety: a life spent in the defense of the Christian religion.

I do not want to write any sort of “thing.” I do not want to fit into any sort of “style.” Boredom has become my biggest fear. There is so much to do? Well, if you see the Nothing of everything, the excitement is no longer there.

Writing should be fun. Who wants to educate? Not me. Learn yourself! Figure it all out on your own! I am here to figure my world out! My world is what’s entertaining! You need to go see a movie, spend a night at a restaurant…I need to sit alone and think!

I have myself and that’s all.

I need to realize that I am “smart” enough to figure things out. I need to understand that I have discovered particular ‘truths’ all on my own. Well, maybe not all on my own, but it feels like I have done most of the legwork. I need to remember that there is ‘thinking’ and there is ‘writing’ and then there is a combination of both. There are no time limits. I may write for the next few years. I have a decent start. If I change my mind on particular ideas, whether big or small, significant or trivial, I do not want to stop writing about Nihilism. Nihilism is my God. I want to write to defeat Nihilism, and hence, become God. If I do change my mind, in anyway, then I will write something new. I will not replace everything I have said so far. What I have written is important…to me! I need to write like this, in order to transplant it into my writings. It’s funny, because my Professor told me that my writing was “a style all its own”. I wonder if I am picking up on a bit of sarcasm? If not, he does not even have an idea! I will write what I want to write, from now on! If no one wants to read it, so much better for me!

I feel the release when I write. So, then, I must write. This is not to impress, this is to live! I used to have a sense of wonder. I still do, but I have no patience for anything technical. It feels that since I think everything is pointless, there is nothing deserving of acquiring or understanding that involves hard-work.

Let me produce for me. I have myself and this is all. Hattie saw them shut me down. I cannot even talk to them, even the ones who agree with me. That’s strange, no? Yes, it is. This is a nightmare. I have to kill myself sooner than later. I need to give up. But “give up” simply means to do the most defiant/complacent act a human being can do. It will give me the sense of power that is needed to be human. No one has the power I have. I don’t need to read someone to tell me that people are crazy. Consciousness is a joke. Writing for others is not worth it, since they cannot experience my experiences. I will never write for anyone else again. I am not here to share ideas. I am not hear to share, nor receive any “wisdom.” Once you understand the “truth” of Nihilism, all else is silly. All efforts, all everything. Even the response is not worth it. Of course I knew all these things already. I do not need confirmation.  I will be dead.  They will be dead. This means that both glory and criticism will perish, at least in any meaningful sense, since the first-hand experiences of glory and criticism will no longer exist. 

I have music. I have the Harpsichord. Aggressive, beautiful, chaotic, yet overflowing with melody…This cannot be the work of God, but the work of a mind that is panicked with Nihilism. You can proclaim God’s inspiration, but we all know the true inspiration for God, and that is Nihilism. Nihilism is the starting point from which all religions, all “solutions”, are born. You must finish your music, not to please a God without ears, but to solidify your “eternal” place within Human history.

I find myself very clever too. Unfortunately, we all do. The “cliche man” finds his words just as entertaining the first time he says them, until the last breath that comes out his thoughtless mouth.

Things don’t “seem right” to me. This is all too weird. All interaction is weird. Once I convince myself that “happiness” is not a cure for my finite nature, then I may be able to be okay. My existence will be as insignificant as anyone else.

_All history books will eventually be lost. Every_ _melody that Bach ever pieced together will eventually disappear…forever._

One of the deepest illusions that the sense of subjectivity gives a person is the idea that their lives matter in such a way that somehow even in their death they are benefited by the lives that they have lived! HA! This is such delusional thinking, if nihilism is true, which it seems, overwhelmingly, to be the case.

I haven’t been writing much. Who am I going to be able to talk to anyway? He still wants to read another man’s writings and dissect them. Those ideas are not important. You find them interesting, but are they _important?_ Where is the motivation to do anything coming from? I do not feel that I have anything left to do here. I do not feel that there is anything left for me to do. I almost want to stay around in order to accomplish something great. But we all know there is no such thing. All desires to do great things are misguided. The pull between death and life is so strong. It’s honestly the only part of me that I feel is truly “insane.” The drives between both worlds, between the illusions of life, and the strangeness of existence.

I have nothing but myself. I do not mean people are not around me, attempting to “help” me. But they do not understand what my world is. Your right, my world, is my world. The same way, your world, is your world. I cannot take any criticism seriously, because all criticisms are equally nonsensical. As all assertions are nonsensical. I cannot explain my experiences. I cannot get upset at people for not understanding me. I cannot understand them…maybe I understand them too well. I feel that I, like some others that I know, are sensitive enough to grasp a deeper, yet still insufficient, experience of another person.

Why do I feel that I need to change the way that I speak in order to not sound “crazy” to other people?

I am no longer interested in the Cosmological argument.

Classical music has pushed back the boredom, for the time being. This is something that may not last. Hours upon hours of music, all very complicated, I hope this is enough to last a lifetime.

I have nothing to prove.

[Apr**1**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/23/ "April 1 2016")

I am very tired as of late. I am beating my body up. Working too much and too hard, not sleeping or eating properly. I am barely surviving. This sort of existence does not even allow me to create anything. I need to stop and see what happens. Yes, indeed. Stop and see what happens.

I feel that I understand how things are, yet I do not want the responsibility to struggle against it. The world is Nothing. How do you fight against nothing?

The most deep, the most intellectual, the most serious, are the most ridiculous. You are an ape or you are Human. Grunt like an ape or speak like a God, but don’t do one, if you are the other. I do not know how to tell who is who, what is what. Do I pretend or is it _not_ pretend? But everyone is living wrong. They are preoccupied with nonsense. Greed, ignorance, etc. They want bright lights and loud noises to distract them. If we were not apes, then why would so many of us be ruined? Why would so many of us be disgusting, defective, so unlike anything Divine, if we were so Special? Your grand words do produce a bit of electricity within our veins. But this may be, this _is_, nothing but a delusion. How do we live knowing that our pursuits, our interests, our everything, is a delusion? Art, knowledge, all the “important” aspects of human subjectivity are reduced to a laughing stock! Allan Watts? You speak with such confidence, such grandiose! But, unless you are speaking of Nothing, you must be mad, since there is no reason to speak of knowledge or importance; any talk about such things are necessarily ridiculous. Do I listen to you or do I laugh at you? Do I search for guidance and knowledge? Or do I _know_ you are as ignorant as I, and therefore must be I must be left alone in my thoughts, whatever they are, no matter how “crazy” they are?

Maybe certain drugs strip away the boundaries of reality and let us see what life really is: either Nihilism or an experience that shows that this world is not our True world.

Why must I write in any particular form? Is everyone else just not capable of following along? Or is what I am saying too boring? Could I try to “dumb” down the experience? If I did, then the experience would seem lackluster, necessarily, and therefore, not worth reading. If I let the experience take over and speak for itself, then I am accused of “nonsense” or “obscurantism.” I will write. This is what I will do. I will write what I want to write and that’s it. Philosophy is bothersome, too much work for no result. No results! The results are simply in my head. I am not mad. I am here, in reality, in full reality.

_All the information at my fingertips is incredible. I understand why the “intellectuals” of the past were not riddled with doubt: they were ignorant of their ignorance._

I want to write, but I don’t. I don’t even want to discuss. I want to have the one-sided conversation that I always have. I would rather just be able to keep record of it.

I need an outlet though. Why do I need to be heard? Thinking is over rated. Let’s just sit and relax for a bit.

Why can I not write whatever it is I want to write, yet combine other thoughts, aphorisms, within the same work? Who says that I cannot do this? I can, and will do, whatever I want! I do not need advice! I need breakthrough! Avoid drugs? Avoid bad thoughts? No! I will charge head first! I will be brave! I will spend my entire life in the attempt at bravery, only to become brave enough to end the life I am attempting to overcome!

I am attempting to write away my issues. I will never get there. I don’t think.

“I am a lonely soul.” Give me a break. That’s the best you can do before you end everything? Ah, yes, but of course. I still have energy! I have not given up, as much as I’d like to think that I have.

The not so arbitrary values of society are what dictate the drugs we consider indispensable (alcohol) or bad (cocaine).

Of course a psychologist is capable of sounding confident, since they are working so closely within their Meaningful Logic. Anything that goes against this logic will necessarily be seen as foreign or sickly.

Why do humans need the assurance of a stranger’s voice? Is my voice not enough? Are you not really listening to me? What are you hearing when I speak to you? It seems that you are not hearing _me._ It seems that you are ignorantly trapped within your own preconceptions.

I don’t want to take orders from an ignorant idiot who thinks they know what they are talking about. What kind of existence is this? This is not how I want my life to be. I hate you. I hate you all so much. I quit. This feeling of emotion, this is what is seen as insane, this is what is so true. This is my truth. I do not care if this truth blows my brains out or if I rule the world. I don’t care if you think what I am saying is nonsensical, or whether I am speaking Gospel. I do not lack awareness. Existence does not make sense. I understand it perfectly. I will erase everything. I cannot do this. I would rather do anything else.

As everyone drops dead, so do their judgments. I need to release all pretensions concerning the judgments of everyone.

So, what do I do with this opening? I am not crazy. Everyone tells me that I “make sense.” Ha! I love that! They say it with the strongest sense of surprise in their voices! I am ALWAYS thinking. Why cannot I not do this? Why is this “wrong”? Because I do not fit into the system that I despise? I am mentally ill, because I do not like anything I see around me. I have developed my own thoughts! I am not a cheat! I am not a fake! What do you mean he sounds “crazy”? Not only is what he saying not “crazy”, it’s already exactly what I thought, yet everything around me says that I am wrong!! Now I know that others really do see what I see!

I do not know much, if anything. I especially do not know how to hide how little I know! If I know more or a decent amount more than most people, then why do I pretend like I don’t? Why do I have to pick my words so carefully? Why do I have to play dumb? Why do I need to run and hide? Why can’t I say what _he_ is saying? How, or why, do people listen to him and not me? It’s not that I even want them to listen to me, I just want to be free. I want to live the simplest existence. I need to be able to hear music. It’s so complicated.

I felt a fear where I do not want to.

I have never met anyone whose intelligence intimidates me. I was tricked into feeling social pressures of intimidation from traditional social roles, but that’s it. This is MY EXISTENCE! I am the Hero! I am the Hero! I do not need to be judged! By who? A nobody? What was I doing? What am I doing? Write! With confidence about WHAT YOU KNOW! I do not need to write on anything but my experiences!

Are humans all the same? If I am using humans as an argument against God, because God could not have created such a thing, then if people are a result of a shitty social structure, then God may still exist. BUT, how could humans be the sorts of creatures that are capable of being mislead, exactly like a herd of cattle? He’s a Nihilist with a positive Drug enhanced solution.

Nihilism could be defeated. He’s an Optimistic-Cynical Nihilist! Ha! How is this possible? He has seen things in his consciousness that I have not. What am I missing?

I don’t want to write, but I am not sure what else it is that I am _suppose_ to do. I feel that I would rather journal and show no one, than to try to “publish” and restrict my writing. I should not care if you understand me. I should not care if you think I am crazy. There is nothing that I should care about accept my total and utter expression. This is me. This is not me with a suit on! Take it or leave it.

What is “Academic?” I cannot believe anyone would voluntarily stay in this room and listen to this drivel.  As I watch you speak on “The Problem of Evil” to a room full of six (five if the old man in the front is dead and not sleeping), using words that are so obscure, for no good reason except to impress, confuse, or both, I cannot help but think that you are the most insane of all. You are the one who needs help. Where are you getting this confidence? How could it be that you are capable of alienating even the six people in the room with your obscure language? You should be hanging on, with all your might, to any listeners that you can trick into hearing more than just a few of your repugnant sentences. At least try not to ostracize these six, especially through a fallacious act of “intelligence”. You don’t know anything about suffering. You wouldn’t be able to stand there behind that podium and let people suffer if you did. Your lecture is the perfect example of the gratuitous suffering that the atheist is making such a fuss about! Why don’t you want to give up within that _gigantic_ room of six? Is it not awkward, until you realize that you are talking about what you take to be the most important topic in the universe and there are only six people in the room to hear you? Is this not the most important, yet neglected, part of your lecture- the Alienation?

I had to turn you off.  I feel like Nietzsche when he says that he feels that he has seen humanity and how things really are more than anyone else who has ever lived. I do not want to work hard in order to talk to a room of six people.

Why do I always feel the need to change the way that I speak in order to not sound “crazy” to other people?

_Making a Murderer_. Let’s posit a theistic worldview for a second, and assume from this worldview that I either believe Avery to be a complete, psychopathic murderer or he is innocent and there is a far reaching section of the “good guys” who turn out to be the most vile of frauds. These are our only two options. The consequences of Avery being innocent are terrifying, they should scare you. Avery’s innocence “should” shatter the deepest of faiths and the deepest of hopes that anyone alive could ever hold. There doesn’t seem much wiggle room in that last statement, but I think the consequences of this perspective of Avery’s case are significant, if that word is even supposed to have any meaning anymore. This case demolishes certain fundamental beliefs that are seemingly held in a very strong fashion among the masses.  These are issues of freedom, justice, murder, family, trust, corruption, and a particular type of evil, found in the potential conspirators, that is so malignant that it disallows for the concept of some Perfect Being to be the creator of it, of us, of Humans.  Avery is simply my experience of realization to the many, similar acts like those of Galileo’s torture.  

I am collapsing. I cannot be this puppet anymore. You deliver me into Nothing, and I have to appease you! It is because of you that I sometimes feel as if I have already died, and I am supposed to put on a smile in order for me to pass your judgment? _Whose life is crazier: Steven Avery’s or mine?_ Narcissism is always the “trouble”. You have a thought that is not directly in line with the masses, an “original” thought, that is not cloaked in the ideas of another “well-known intellectual”, it is screaming to have its small, “original” voice heard, and we are labeled “Narcissists”. Your criticism of “narcissism” is narcissistic in tone. Is this simply a “misjudgment” on my part or are you really a hypocritical asshole? I know what you are.

I _see_ everything in my head. I do not need to justify my thoughts to any one, anymore. I can stay in my mind, I can live here. I am aware of my suffering. This is what is keeping me attached to myself.

Mitchell Heisman- of course he blew his brains out for some other reason than for why he said he was going to do it. I am sure that within the two-thousand pages of his writing there is nothing about why he _had_ to take his own life. It really is a “mystery”, isn’t it? No wonder you “didn’t see this coming”. It was right in front of your face, all along, and you were blind. It may not be _your_ responsibility, since it was _his_ life, but do you not feel guilty as a Human, a Mother, a Friend, a person who loves him? This is what makes it possible for you to stare down at two-thousand pages (granted it’s not all _explanation_) and still proclaim that you “don’t know why” he did what he did?! Maybe Nihilism is not contagious. People recoil from Nihilism in the same way they recoil from the heat of a flame; this recoil is so sensitive that even the slightest exposure to a flame commands their body to react in such a way as to avoid becoming completely engulfed by the fire. A person’s consciousness is protected in a very similar way, which is how it is that people can “stand too close” to me, yet they are not drowned by the Nihilism.

I believe that most of Heisman’s writing is, unfortunately, “filler”. Well, only to us. I fully comprehend the adrenaline of self-expression that comes from writing all of this “filler”. The “filler” is either the most important part or the most worthless of all the worthless.  I’m not sure which one it is though; obviously, it all simply depends on my mood. “If only he could have ‘tamed’ his intellect, with the help of a mentor, a counselor, a psychotherapist…right?” This misunderstands his (two-thousand word) argument in its entirety. You’re still working with the common “Euclidean Logic”. Of course he couldn’t have killed himself because of the reasons _he_ gave as to why he was committing his act. It’s right there in his words, it’s all perfectly clear why he killed himself, stop acting like you’re confused!

Heisman was not perfect! He recognized the criticism of “treating his nihilism as something meaningful”, but it seems that he either did not care or did not know how to “escape” this criticism. Actually, he most likely was aware of this “escape”. Yet his awareness didn’t stop him from attempting to take his Nihilism “beyond himself”. There seems to be a pretty simple way for the nihilist to side-step this “objection”.  It is actually pretty simple, and I will tell you what it is: he should have never entered into the Human realm. For some strange reason, most people, want to go “outside” themselves and their experiences. They want to, for lack of a better word, “project” themselves on to the world, in a very broad and sloppy sense.  The first and last sections of his book are _him,_ purely him. They do not involve history or any type of theory that involves other humans (his ideas may have the consequence of involving other humans, but he does not need to address other existences in order for his words to be coherent). Of course his main concept, that of Nihilism, will bleed into every other aspect of his thought, but I am simply not interested in this type of talking. You’ve already told me everything is a waste of time. _It seems that the only thing worth talking about, in any “serious” fashion, is our comparison of, and union in, the nihilistic experience._ When Heisman is writing about _this_, it’s incredible. When he leaves himself, when he enters into the Human realm, which is the majority of his letter, it becomes boring, it becomes an even greater fiction than life already seems to be. I can imagine my own reality, my subjectivity is just as great, if not greater than yours, you can keep those thoughts, for the mood I am in now at least.  I wish he wrote two-thousand pages _directly_ concerning his nihilism, regardless of his final conclusions, that would have been heaven. I would not have felt “cheated” that he was referencing something so distant from his “self”, his experience, turning the speculation into something downright laughable, if not just boring. He needed advisement on his book, he finished it too early.

He is not “smart”. He “saw” things that many others don’t. His mind, through either intelligence (however many ways we care to define this), depression, trauma, whatever the catalyst was, stripped everything from him, destroyed his entire inner experience. Of course, people can criticize someone who just did something as “incredible” as he did, of course! Of course we have so-called “negative” words about him! How could someone using his _“_logic”, put forth such an effort, follow his ideas to their logical conclusion, and be anything but admired for Consistency?! I can understand a criticism of his history, theology, biology, etc. but not an outright “confusion” for why he did what he did. Heisman did predict that his work would be “repressed”. Well, he was proven “right”. _This_ is the ultimate repression- _not taking him at his word!_

He had to have been “mentally ill” to believe that his existence was somehow worse than his “nonexistence”! Of course! “His note? No, I am not going to read that, that would tell me why he committed suicide, and I am afraid that it might make a little bit too much sense to me!”

Whatever arbitrary label you want to throw onto him, he did something incredible. He _lived_ out a type of ultimate, philosophical work.  

“It makes me sad and angry that he didn’t care for any facet of life other than the book.’’ This is the Common Person’s response to Heisman. Of course _you_ are angry that another creature similar to yourself is not enjoying life or taking it to be Good. Yes, this is very upsetting. How dare he expose you to Nihilism. To think, you almost became contaminated! You deserve to be furious with your friend who has killed himself at thirty-five years of age, that’s definitely consistent on your part. Rather, may I suggest instead, that maybe you “ought” to be upset (“jealous” is probably more appropriate a word for the person who dare critiques the nihilist in this way) that in his short-lived existence of thirty-five years, he had extracted more “years of living” simply within his mind than you could hope to experience within your mental and physical realms combined, even if you were “blessed” with two-hundred years on this earth! You are an ignorant fool and you have your protection, whatever the thing is that protects consciousness from Nihilism, to thank or to blame for it, your choice.

“It’s not like someone who was really depressed because they lost a lover. His whole ideology was wrapped in this concept of nihilism. I wish we could have made him see things differently.’’ Well, at least you understood this much.

I cannot make sense of any thing or any one, including myself, because everything is an accident. I am an accident. You cannot make sense of an accident. You cannot place reason or purpose on an accident. You cannot create a meaning for accidents. In order to invent a “perspective”, especially of the kind that would be strong enough to defeat Nihilism, there would have to be a certain lack of awareness in order for a person to exist, authentically, as anything more than a delusion.  But this is exactly what Nihilism stops you from being able to do!  _The cure is therefore preventative, by necessity, since the Hopeful Perspective is only conceivable to someone who is not already infected with Nihilism._ Everything must _not_ make sense; not if God exists, but if Nihilism is true.

I read through a book, _Awareness,_ that seemingly helped quite a few people, but even with his “new” words, that I quite thoroughly enjoyed, I did not read anything I did not already know. These are the answers: God or Nothing. I see Nothing, all too clearly. _The nonsense only makes sense on Nihilism!_ Of course we cannot live with Nihilism, we are aware of our existence! We cannot “move on” or “enjoy the short time we have” when Nihilism is true. The “short time” is nothing enjoyable. Once a person realizes that the Nihilistic or Absurd Perspective is “true” yet contradictory, since the Positive Perspective of life is also “true”, then they have discovered everything there is to know about life. Too sweeping a claim? It can’t be _this_ simple! Unfortunately, it is. _Once a person is aware that each and all perspectives are “true”, “consistent”, or whatever other nonsense you want to saddle it with, that the person screaming for the nihilist to “snap out of it” is, at the same time, maintaining as “true” a perspective as the nihilist’s own position (and infinitely many more), then we have fully encountered the Nothing._ The Human _just is_ Nothing now, everything has been swept clean; it’s empty. I am not trying to write cryptically. This is just how it is. The best part is that nihilists, the ones who are “most” aware, are _forced_ to put this contradictory form of meaning onto their Nihilism in order to simply move. I can only be Human. I can only be what it is that I am. I am “stuck” here; but in reality, I am not. The concept of suicide is the tiny release of air from the tire that is about to explode. It creates just enough mental space to allow one to keep breathing. You cannot help me. I am here, this is where I belong. It’s true to me. Of course yours is just as true, so I need not try to argue or persuade you. I am here. I am alone. You are not here for me, not because you don’t want to be, but because you can’t. My suffering seems empirically “worse” than others, mostly due to the awareness that I can _only pretend_ that it is.

Heisman lived _a_ perfect representation of a Nihilistic life. His life was polite and seemingly “normal”. A recluse, due to most likely a combination of boredom and anxiety that comes with experiencing other humans. Right in step, he was also seemingly only interested in what his mind could create, which was the Nothingness of existence. It _is_ entertaining, so I cannot fault him. “Selfish”- what else is there? I am here, alone. You are there, alone. We are standing right next to each other, all alone. _That an accident can be accused of anything is laughable, but what is “deplorable” is that an accident can be blamed for being something that it necessarily is,_ _that it has to be, without possibility for change. I cannot even write one sentence_ _without the truth of the last statement seeping it’s way through, without a contradiction arising._  The impossibility of my “condemnations”, my awareness of the necessary inconsistency, surprisingly, allows me to keep thinking, for a while longer at least.

It’s impossible to make sense of the truth that doesn’t exist. It seems like one should be able to say something about existence, if God in fact exists, without being drowned out by the cacophony of contradictory perspectives that arise within ones mind, all which conveniently come with their own sense of “rationality” or “possibility”.

I enjoy the criticisms that I read about the people who think as I think. Their mindless criticisms are still using the old logic of Meaning, Purpose, and Value. They have not become aware that we are _condemned_ to speak in contradictions. Our language is “clear”? Our language is “obscurantist”? These are the same things, or don’t you understand yet? _Read it or don’t, it doesn’t matter; you either experience it or you do not, words on a page will only give you recollections of the experience that you have. Words cannot develop an experience for you, it will not augment your experience in any sort of way, not that you should want this. Put another way, without the first-hand experience of Nihilism, the pages may as well be filled the words of a foreign language. For as with a foreign language, you will surely take the words written as self-evident examples of nonsense ramblings; and rightfully so, if Nihilism were true!_ Ha!

Why do we say the same thing in so many ways? Well, we should know why, it’s because we are forced, we do not have a choice. My ramblings are just that, ramblings. But so are yours. So is every thought, idea, belief, faith, etc. you will ever think, speak, or act. It will all lead to Nihilism. The void is seemingly endless. It subsumes everything.

Discovering that others have thought like me is something; I am not sure what it is, but it is something. “Narcissism” is not a criticism, it’s a truth. Well, it’s a truth within a particular perspective, obviously (right? Ha!). We understand the world through a perspective, we then guide our speech and movements through this perspective, a perspective that may evolve either slightly or in its entirety over the course of its existence, all while interacting with other conflicting perspectives. We criticize, laugh, cry, sulk, sigh, etc. through this perspective. The problem is that no perspective is “right”, or at least my perspective makes this claim, and the absurd consequence of this “truth” is that the actions listed above (and infinitely more!) instantly become nonsensical. We are laughing and crying over the same thing. We are yelling and whispering about the same thing. We are excited and destroyed over the same thing. The “truth” of the Nihilistic perspective seems to be lived out in the most full sense whenever I think, see, breath…It’s everywhere, all around me. There is no escaping this.

You will understand what Nihilism is when you read a “suicide note” and immediately begin to criticize it. “It’s too short.” “It’s doesn’t say enough.” “It says the wrong things.” “This could have been ‘better‘, in some way…” The person who has participated in the ultimate taboo is in no condition for criticism. Criticism of suicide is only possible through the means of an illusion. They have done _it._ They will have done more with this one act than all of the movements combined from your finite, natural existence. They deserve to be Deified.

You are not upset about money, you are upset that you are chasing a phantom. You are not upset over someone “breaking up” with you, you are afraid of being alone with the awareness that “love” doesn’t exist. You are not sad because someone close to you has died, you are upset to realize that all of your struggles and accomplishments will end up like that lifeless carcass of meat that you see before you. You see death in yourself, which is why you hate it. You hate death because it is inevitable. Our existence just seems to be the search for something concrete, something to grasp on to that won’t dissipate in our hands, between our very fingers; and yet, the Inevitable that we do happen to come across, we seem to reject with an especially vicious breed of contempt.

Why do I have this insatiable urge to write, to express my stupid ideas? My ideas are not original, only the subjective experiences of these words, my thoughts, are uniquely mine. And since I cannot express these experiences properly with words, there is no more reason for me to write. Ha! You have just witnessed Nihilism’s Logic in all its glory! Imagine _this_ Logic, as natural to me as breathing, chasing down with amazing precision every single thought that has, or will ever, become the type of thing that we would consider a consequence of our consciousness. What would you do with this? How would you even _begin_ to go about an attempt at defeating something like this? Look at me though, I am still writing…Ha! Regardless! I guess you have to do _something_…don’t you?

I would feel like a phony if I were to ask for “help”, since I am already aware, even as my verbal words are spewing my “nihilistic despair”, my experience, _my_ logic, is telling me that what I am speaking is “nonsense”. “Shut your whining, you sound like an over-dramatic moron. Do you hear yourself? You’re just a pathetic loser. Stop being such a fucking baby about everything! You sound stupid, why are you even doing this?”

How the fuck could you even want, never mind muster up the energy, to participate in other conversations after a few hours in this stupid mind of mine?  Maybe I need to be surrounded by people that are also expressing illusions, or delusions, or whatever, but in such a grandiose way, that it’s entertaining to hear about their imaginings. Nihilism’s conclusion is too _final_ for everyone_._ There is no “way out”, so we need not discuss it. If there is no “happy ending”, then we would be “better off” not even to begin to entertain its possibility. Should I still push the issue just for fun? Maybe this is an idea.

# [Christmas](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/christmas/)

[Dec**25**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/christmas/ "December 25 2015")

It really does feel like the world is closing in on me. Sometimes, when I read the words of others, I am not sure whether I am thinking my thoughts or theirs. On particular occasions, I feel that in some sense I am “unaware” of my own thoughts and their origins; and yet, here I am thinking it impossible for there to be any better words to describe my experiences, they do it perfectly. Is this simple coincidence? What a strange connection. Those thoughts, the way they “come to me”, and now, how I feel…weird. Maybe I do have a way with words. Probably not. My self-doubt, even in things I feel I “know” a lot about, is omnipresent.

Ligotti talks with such confidence, which is both ironic and, at least in some minimal fashion, warranted. I understand what he is saying, I am living what he is saying. Yet, he writes with such confidence, about something “little”, about a small community of people who understand, who experience _this._  There are no reviews, no words written about this work; he is an unknown.

People _could_ laugh at Ligotti. People _do_ laugh at me. You wouldn’t laugh if you lived his writings, if you lived my thoughts. Turning my experiences into _The Laughable Perspective-_ it’s almost unbelievable that you are capable of displaying such forms of absolute power and complete weakness, not simply in their solitude, which would be impressive enough, but in an even more baffling fashion, at the exact same time! You don’t understand, rightfully so, your brain is working “properly”. My perspective does not need validation, since no perspective is in need of validation. It’s incredible. Talk about complete and utter freedom. It’s even worse than I thought.

# [12/22](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/1222/)

[Dec**23**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/1222/ "December 23 2015")

Every action, every movement is reduced to stupidity. I can’t even _think_ my way out of this, for the simple fact that I can’t reason outside of the absurd “structure”. I can look at any sort of action and turn it into an embarrassment. Every movement, for sure. I am not sure about every thought; I think the isolated nature of Thoughts may “save” them, in some small way, from the Nihilism.  Regardless, there is always the _Absurd_ _Perspective,_  which is itself a thought and therefore within the constant state of possible escape from Nihilism, which physical movements necessarily cannot escape. For, literally, every movement there is an absurd perspective that is ready to force itself upon that situation. It would be a description of frustration, shame, terror, panic… But then it disappears as fast as it comes. Relaxation, for however brief it exists, exists. For a few phantasmagorical moments, you can breathe. But don’t start to become conscious that you are in this state. Awareness is the end of your relief. Your relief becomes swallowed up, in its entirety, by the Nihilism. I can imagine that it would almost be like watching two friends, where one gets murdered by the other.  It would seemingly be like watching a friend, an abused wife, who is weaker and more delicate than the husband, get inevitably wiped out, over and over again, right in front of your eyes.  And for the strangest of reasons (that are most vehemently rejected by the others who you vainly attempt to defend your friendship with him to) you consider him your best friend. So, you care for the wife, she is your friend as well. She is also in a bad spot. Her husband, who always seems to get what he wants, wants her dead. He’s coming for her, both you and her know this, and neither of you can do anything. The husband finds her, and kills her in such a forceful (and yet almost sweeping and soft) manner; he then continues to repeat this act, over what feels like will last, for an eternity. Your friend is killed right before your very eyes, in an infinite circle of the most vicious movements, and there is nothing you can do about it. At certain times, maybe even most times, you secretly enjoy watching your friend get destroyed. It brings the only sensations of “life” that you allow yourself to any longer have.

It was a little relaxing to think about _why_ what I am experiencing is even happening and not so much the exact sensations that I am directly experiencing. How could it be that these sort of experiences could even be a thing? It’s insane that there is “anything” at all. But then to have this “anything” be the sorts of “things” that are my experiences, just doesn’t make any sort of sense. I cannot even attempt to begin to reason through all the nonsense. But hasn’t that been what I have been attempting to do all this time? Ha!

No Morality and it’s over. If actors, musicians, and athletes, instead of holding all these extravagant award shows, where they all pat each other on the backs with stacks of hundred dollar bills, instead put that money to good use, how many children dying from lack of clean water do you think could be saved? How could anything matter when humans are so stupid as to hold “charity events” to raise money, when all the money they need is right there at the event?! Don’t ask the poor and regular folk to donate the little bit of money they have. All these _appearances!_ All these special people who have the money to alleviate, but instead they would rather ask you for the little bit that you have! Not only did these “humans” receive their precious money while staring directly into the face of Suffering, but their overindulgence, in the name of Comfort, eliminates any sort of credence to anything they do or say from this moment on. Your Humanity should be put in a state of constant suspicion from everyone around you; instead, you are praised and honored. You have not risen above yourself yet. You have not even begun to think like a real Human. Or maybe you are the “perfection” of what it means to be Human.

An Example of an Absurd Perspective- “Toy Drives”. During the holidays, there are people who think they are participating in possibly _the_ best thing a person could do in this Human life- turning a sad child into a happy child. The sad child cannot experience Christmas properly! The sad child is the poor child. The poor child cannot experience Christmas properly. How can we remedy this? How can we convey to children both the fundamental aspects of Christmas and their relations to the “eternal happiness of ourselves” at the same time? How we can take a sad, poor, _earthly_ child and present him with the gift of Eternal Happiness?! _This_ is even possible?! Yes, it is! We can turn every contradiction that we see around us into a necessary truth! No, a better idea than Truth: Cheap Presents. Let’s give the sad children cheap material. Forget Eternal Happiness; gifts instead. The sad children are taught that their happiness, that their “eternal _happiness_” lies in the hands of cheaply made materials. How is this possible? How are “Toy Drives” not seen as the biggest conspiracy theory, the biggest evil, of all? Human movements are _all_ made with the end of “Happiness” in mind, or so thought Aristotle, and we deceive our children into believing that Happiness is found in toys, in junk.

_This_ is what it feels like to be in my brain. Who has thought _this_ before? Am I the harshest Scrooge of all or am I seeing something that is true? Which perspective would you choose? You could argue that it is some kind of combination of these two, but that wouldn’t correlate to reality. People _could_ instill Values _and_ Toys, but I’m looking around the world and all I’m seeing are toys. Lots of toys. I am missing the Moral content of this “charity event”. Isn’t any sort of “thing” that contains the word “charity” in its description taken as Necessarily Moral? “Charity” just _is_ Morality to most people. Not to me, obviously. Do you see the consequences of simply “spreading some Christmas Joy”? They seem disastrous. And I hate to rub it in, but the consequence’s presence is smotheringly obvious, directly in front of our face, at this very moment. So, again, does this perspective show any signs of _coheren__cy_ to you? Is this perspective even the type of thought that you could, at least minimally, entertain as one of your own thoughts? I think _this,_ even being a possibility, brings with it all the justification that it needs. But if you do not, then why not? I cannot help to believe that my perspective is the “right” one, obviously. So, what do you do with this perspective? An infinite amount of counterparts to this example can be had, simply by turning on the television or walking three steps out your front door. It feels very tight.

Another Example of Absurd Reasoning- The _Reno 911_ cop, Perez Hilton, and Emmitt Smith judging the Miss Universe Pageant. What is this occasion even supposed to be? Why would you want these people judging you? For what, exactly? What is your purpose for participating in this event? How could some _thing_ like this even exist? People are dying, as the crown is placed on your stupid head. You want to “win” this contest? Walk out! Tell them you cannot stand on this stage and participate in this nonsensical circus act while there are people dying around the world. “How will I help in making the world a better place? Well, first thing, I will stop pretending that this answer, or anything to do with this circus, has any real consequences. Second, I quit! I am walking off the stage to do something “real”. I will no longer participate in pathetic vanity! I suggest you all do the same and shut this sad excuse for an existence down!”

My discomfort simply comes down to my uncompromising disagreement with every thing I perceive in the world. I cannot live without being judged by someone. _Even though I disagree with them, and with, in all probability, more force and clarity than in the way they disagree with me, I feel like I am the one who is being pushed back into a corner; it is simply a numbers game. I am a true loner._

[Dec**18**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/1216/ "December 18 2015")

I was the highest I had ever been, well, at least in a very long while, and then ripped back down to the lowest I have ever felt, withstanding only a very few instances, all within a twelve hour period. Again, my obsession became stupid, like everything else around me. To feel something, anything, and then have it torn away from you, to have it thrown into the fire, to be utterly demolished; this is not an accurate enough description of what I feel. This isn’t even close. The thoughts came to me fast, while sitting there, completely still; the thoughts in my mind were very rapid in movement, to the point of where my thoughts simulated a sensation of physical movement. It felt as if I was launched out of a cannon, only to be yanked back, in the most violent of ways, by the bungee-cord that had been secretly tied around my stomach. I was just sitting still. It’s exhausting. I yearn for the asylum. Maybe I don’t.  I don’t know.

I did grasp a deeper understanding, as always, from this experience though. My anxiety is due to my having to hide my Nihilism. I cannot be myself, with almost anyone. No one wants to hear what I have to say. They could not handle what I experience. There is nothing wrong with me, there is something wrong with _you!_ You don’t want to talk about existence! I have said this all before, yet I grasp it with more strength than I ever have before. You don’t want to understand, never mind experience, what I have to say. No one would want to be around me, if they knew what was going on inside my brain. I would have no friends, but this time it wouldn’t be voluntary! Ha! There is no longer any wonder as to why I have discovered so much of a release from writing. My mind is put in a cage. Throw away the key! Philosophers, even Academia, do not want to hear what I have to say! You’d rather talk about a ‘theory of knowledge’, rather than ‘God’ or ‘Existence’?!  A waste of time until _these_ questions are answered.  Are the questions unanswerable or do you just not like the answers?  You want to fight off the nihilism too, you impostors of Truth! I cannot blame you though, really. The proof of _this_ thought is that, after years of studying philosophy, I was never introduced to these writers, these thinkers.  Asking “why?” would be silly.

As much “fun” as this is, the isolation is a bit much. Well, it’s not so much the ‘isolation’ as it is the ‘isolation’ plus my lack of self-sufficiency. If I could disappear tomorrow, I would. I would be in the middle of nowhere. I may not survive, mentally or physically, but I am not “surviving” here either…

There is no cure for the absurd! I knew this, I know this. I am a poison. My thoughts make everyone uneasy. Did anyone ever wonder why that is? Have you ever asked why it is that you are so uncomfortable with thinking?! Ah, thinking. I feel like you have to abuse the fuck out of this ridiculous contraption that is stuck between our dumb skulls. Why not push it to its utter limits? Of course it’s so fragile, that makes it all the more fun. I would love to be stolen by madness. A vacation? How about the “never-ending” adventure into madness? Please.

I have finished the book. The repetition of phrases, combined with the forcing of terminology, was a bit annoying.  He was talking to the masses, or at least attempting to be heard by them.  But that’s the only problem I have with it. When he is speaking to me, or us Pessimists, it is nearly a perfect description of the Pessimist’s position; the True Position, it seems to me. This is True Pessimism due to it’s conscious neglect, or rather total rejection, of a Positive conclusion. The confirmation, the validation, is unreal. To know that I have sat in my room all alone, with my only companions being those of simple words and thoughts, and have been able to come to the Truth of Nihilism! I have often questioned the use of philosophy. I have always received some sort of “enjoyment” out of it, as a sort of “game” or “chess”. But I was still, of course, always skeptical as to whether it was more than just a “game”. I mean, I had always hoped, wished, that it was more than just “chess”. It is all too stupidly paradoxical that I have learned “so much” about the world, by simply reflecting on words and thoughts within the walls of my tiny room. Science cannot do this for me. Fuck, science. Philosophy has brought me to this, to the awareness of death, in the most substantial sort of way. I have learned so much through my thoughts, through the, almost literal, tearing apart of my mind.

I always felt that what I said was “right”. What I say is beyond consistent. The words, the thoughts, all of the relations between myself and this book, are beyond description. I finally do not have anything else to say. Well, maybe I do. I can play everything like it’s a simulation now. It sure feels like one. You cannot know the name of this book. If you’re reading anything I write, that is already too much. Although this book seems to hint that some people are just not “capable” of our experiences, I am not convinced. I worry, out of dumb habit, that others may catch what I have. Even with as long as it took for me to “catch” Nihilism, I do not think that it would be too difficult to introduce a person to _it_, to crack the infinitely thin ice that everyone is standing on, the only protection between them and the Nihilism. It’s just a thought away. Just one thought, and that’s it. That’s all. It’s over. There is permanence in this, at least. And if there is not, then that would be more evidence for Nihilism! Ha!

I have written this book myself! I have written these thoughts down, without the help of Zapffe! To read Zapffe, Ligotti, Cioran, etc. and to relate to them is one thing, to discover their truths on your own, to live what they have lived, is another. My defect is the best! Ha! My obsession with “smart” is funny. I am not smart, this is for sure now! My machinery is messed up! But, and this is the best part, not because my thoughts lead to delusion, which is the “normal test” for intelligence (although this concept ‘delusion’ is also Nothing on Nihilism), but because they lead to the “truth”! This is still just a perspective, but it’s a _complete_ perspective. True Nihilism, Ultimate Pessimism, etc. have logical end points! Existence is not a value! There is no “value”! Life is not worth living!

The “evidence” seems overwhelming for Nihilism. But we CANNOT completely deny or simply ignore Theism, at least in its non-religious forms. Are we allowed to assume some sort of “rationality” in order to get theism off the ground? Or is Nihilism so powerful that even granting a non-paradoxical existence is laughable? _Is presuming the Rational, in order to produce arguments, particularly arguments for a Perfect Being, equivalent to another work of “science fiction”?_ The experiences that I have are of this kind of strength. They are just too real, they make too much “sense”. Nihilism is sometimes accused of being a self-refuting position, but it is not. Oh, it’s not even close! Suicide may be a stupid movement, unless it was everyone who was participating, but it’s the _attitude_ of Nihilism and Pessimism that are important here, that are the closest thing to Real, to reality, to truth, to God that any sort of being like ourselves could possibly obtain. This is why I survive. These strange, baffling, non-nonsensical, paradox-ridden experiences, along with those similar moments of ‘ecstasy’ that I receive from particular pieces of music, keep me breathing. Whenever I hear musical tones that completely overwhelm me, they create this desire in me to want to share it with someone else; and a very strong sense or need of having to explain the music, not simply “show” the piece to another person, rushes over me, because I feel that they would not hear what I hear from the music, the same way they do not “see” what I “see” with regards to Existence. You missed that flurry of taps on the ride symbol? How? That was the best part. What were you listening to instead?

I have come to my conclusions, yet I still do not know what to do.

[Dec**18**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/1215/ "December 18 2015")

You get to a point where you see the hand of an adolescent being chopped off by a gigantic sword and you can’t help but smile a tiny bit. _This_ just _is_ the world. I would love to be in solitude, somehow surviving within my own thoughts, only to be eliminated by the beautiful, bright lights of an incoming nuclear firestorm.  I can imagine a last, few moments of complete terror, which would stem from my instinct, mixed together with complete relief, which would be the consequence of my thinking self.  That doesn’t sound awful to me.

No wonder for all the confusion. I can see both optimistic and pessimistic conclusions. Which one to choose? I do not _know_, of course, but I think I know. This contradiction is an obvious result of the absurdity of our situation. Why, or _how,_ could I have expected anything different? How naive of me. If I had any energy, I would be mad at myself. I cannot believe I would be so foolish as to think there was a _solution!_ Of course there would not, there _could not_, be a solution. That there could be a solution was my biggest assumption of all, yet my last to become aware of. How silly and obvious. I feel, like with most of my experiences, the words do not match the intensity of the experience. When I hear the words “life is a contradiction”, I know that I have heard, thought, spoken these words before, but I have not experienced them, in the way that I am experiencing them at this moment. To think that my worldview does not even allow me to be _disappointed_ with myself! Ha! I cannot be disappointed with the obvious and necessary.

-The reflections on evolution and consciousness, and the consequences of the former being the cause of the latter, is such a big theme in his book as it is within my thoughts.

Pessimism is the force behind my persistent anti-authoritarianism. The Ultimate Rejection of Tradition- The pessimists most pessimistic revolt is against the “hanging on to life”, the overwhelmingly common acceptance that Life is a “Good”. Reject religion, reject family, reject values, reject society, reject _life_ itself. It seems that Pessimism, the full rejection of life, is the cause of all the former rejections.  However, pessimism does not become fully actualized _until_ all the former rejections of life culminate into Ultimate Pessimism-_the full realization of what it is to wholly and utterly reject life._ _This_ experience is the Ultimate. This experience is the absolute. This experience is perfection. To know that my second life is out there, waiting for me. I do not know what to do. I just want to sit here and be left alone. I want to feel this forever. I revel in this feeling. Fleeting as it is, its contingency does not seem to be ruining my experience, or my “ecstasy”, as Ligotti describes it.

Shame is an illusion. I have been tricked into believing that “shame” was a real _thing_.  Maybe I am wrong about this though…

Of course no “good reason” has been given in favor of Positivity (I refuse the use of the word ‘optimist’, since I take that concept to be so _overly_ contradictory that its existence is even too much of a contradiction for this contradictory world), because no one wants to talk about God, the Perfect Being. If you are not talking about God, then I am correct and you have nothing of interest to contribute to my thoughts. _You cannot help me, but you can join me!_

One minute I am mesmerized by the similarity in our thoughts, and the next I am disgusted with myself for wasting any amount of time reading your words, thinking my thoughts. _It_ really does take over everything. Beyond powerful. An indescribable feeling. Which is why, even after all of this, I still believe the experience is worth chasing. It is overwhelming in the best and worst possible ways. I asked myself when Cioran would “get old”. Well, it took a day. An entire day. So long, I wonder why. I am finding his language strange tonight. Is it because he is attempting to describe an experience that is impossible to describe? Or is he just bragging a bit? In his section on “Melancholy”, he is mutilating his writing into a thing of fiction. He is no longer describing _his_ perceptions, but he is attempting to _throw_ his perceptions onto a particular hypothetical. Reading something of this sort reminds me of Leibniz and his Monads. I do not feel that I gain anything from reading things like this. You have gone _beyond_ what you can communicate to me with any amount of confidence. When Cioran goes beyond himself, he begins to sound like Nietzsche, he enters into the realm of fiction, and it is _this_ that I don’t like. The “problem” is that I am _not_ reading his words like I listen to a musician’s notes_._ I cannot expect to “like” every song, on every album, of certain musicians that I prefer. I need to read the parts I like and enjoy them. I need to know why I enjoy some parts and dislike many others. As long as I know, this is fine.

The end of “all is dust” is one of many examples where I do not simply relate, in some metaphoric sense, but rather it is something that I experience, in the fullest sense of the word. I am living his thoughts. “Exact” is not a strong enough word.

This is why I hesitate to talk to people- “renunciation”. Why spoil others enjoyment with my knowledge?

On True Isolation/Morality- “Renounce? But how? Are we to become saints with roofs over our heads?”

Enough comparison for one night.

[Dec**16**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/16/1212/ "December 16 2015")

**Emil Cioran.** This is the first person who truly understands. All other philosophy may be forgotten now.  I have always claimed that certain philosophers (maybe _just_ Kierkegaard) have come close, but still miss the mark, whether in some simple or significant way. Cioran is, I am, Ultimate Pessimism. Cioran writes in clear, yet obscure language. We have experienced the same experience.  We share the same experience. Our thoughts are interchangeable. He is the first True Nihilist that I have ever read.  To associate Cioran with Nietzsche is to be stupid.  To call him a “rambling narcissist” is to be stupid.  To lump him in as a “pessimistic” or “nihilistic” philosopher is to be stupid. Cioran _is_ Nihilism.  Coiran just _is P_essimism. He (as I believe I am) is the logical conclusion of our experiences.

Why have I never heard of this man before?  It’s most likely because people cannot understand him.  I understand him, but not like others that claim some sort of vain “relation” to his writings, that claim to take something “beneficial” from his writings.  I _live_ his experience.  There is no positive.  A true understanding of him, of _the_ experience, of True Nihilism, entails the diminishment of any Positivity_._ Anything “taken” from his writings, from _the_ experience, is contradictory, and therefore both positive and negative at the same time, in the most uneasy of ways. To find your lonely, isolated, abstract thoughts and experiences within someone else, to know that you have written the exact words as his without knowing of his existence, is beyond comprehension.  I wish I could speak with Cioran, but only for a few minutes, since we would most likely bore each other. Or maybe the opposite, we would talk for a while, since we would finally find excitement in the words of another, but only because our narcissism would recognize that the other person’s words were simply our own.

What do I do with this?  When will I eventually disagree with this too? I have had this feeling of “oneness” with other things before. I have felt that other things are me. Yet, after a while, I come to separate myself from these things, proving that we were, in fact, two different entities all along. It took me years to “disagree” with Clifford’s _Ethics of Belief_. I still do not _fully_ disagree with it, I still find some remnants of truth in his words, it is just not the Gospel that I once hailed it to be. I was once moved by Clifford. Now I am in simple “agreement” with him, in the broadest sense.  I feel that Cioran may be different though.  This isn’t a simple “similarity”.  This is an experience, an overwhelming one at that.  My distrust and disgust for _the_ experience, that both I and Cioran have, makes complete sense, once the experience is fully understood.

_Finding Cioran is both exhilarating and tiring at the exact same time!_ Ha!  But of course it is!  What else could it possibly be, if you truly understood our experiences?  I feel like a weight has been lifted, and replaced with a heavier weight!  Ha!

Craig said that he has, for years, been “baffled” as to why people cannot understand the “Moral Argument”. I comprehend why people do not understand the Moral Argument. I didn’t listen to your answers because I already knew what you were going to say, and I disagree with it-Narcissism. But I still read what you had to say, and it wasn’t anything that I find _moving._ How is this _my_ fault? My views seem more interesting than yours because they seem more closely correlated to the Truth or “truth”, I don’t know.

How is it that Wittgenstein can be hailed as one of the greatest philosophers of our time, yet he needed to “restructure” a house because the roof was three centimeters too low? _Three centimeters!_ I feel like if I was put in a room with this type of person, I would tell them how ridiculous they were. Storming out of the room when you didn’t like what a particular person had to say? What sort of behavior is this? You believe in God and you act like this? How is it even _possible_ for you to act in such ways, if you are a creation of a Perfect Being? Why aren’t you aware of your idiotic actions? Why would you act in such ways, if you’re such a special creation? It seems that your “genius” and your “stupidity” are arbitrary. One is no more True or “important” than the other. I see a contradiction when I see “crazy” mixed with “genius”, which I have been seeing a lot of lately. There is a _contradiction_ like that of two plus two equaling five.

_I am the Ultimate Pessimist_. Nietzsche? Schopenhauer? I don’t see any _Nihilism_ here. Someone has to be the bleakest, no?

# [12/3](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/123/)

[Dec**4**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/123/ "December 4 2015")

“Positivity”. No, this cannot be correct. Positivity seems to promote complacency. Maybe everyone shouldn’t think like myself, but to act “positively”, and promote it as some sort of “philosophy”, is to fall into a different kind of arrest than that of Nihilism. The positive outlook is so pathetic! It is giving up, but not in a consistent way, like the Nihilist. The Pathetic person wants to say that everything is alright, that every thing is “just fine”. It’s to ignore our problems. In other words, it’s to ignore our existence. The Pathetic person does not think everything is “okay” or that everything is “good”, yet their reaction to existence is a peculiar one. It is the _truly lazy_ mentality, which the Nihilist is so often accused of. The Nihilist does not like what she sees around her. She shuts down, since there is no ultimate difference in her actions. There is not any “progress”, only mere change, from one state of affairs to the next, and so on, and so on… The definition of arbitrary. The Pathetic person is trying to hold on to their secret. The Pathetic secret is that, like the Nihilist, she hates what is surrounding her. One should not have to be told to “put on a happy face”. It’s either authentic, or it is not. The Pathetic person though, instead of retreating into, for lack of a better word, “despair”, pretends to conquer existence by never fully facing it. The Pathetic person cannot initiate any progress, since everything is already “fine” and “okay”. The Pathetic person has surrendered, yet continues to pretend, to go through the motions, day after day, with that forced smile upon their face. Maybe worse, with a sincere smile.  What kind of existence is worse than this?  What a sham! _This_ is what _effort_ looks like to the Nihilist. The person who acts out in the world, promotes “progress”, actually helps others, etc., is still nothing more, regardless of all the kicking and screaming, than the frozen figure of “positivity”. The Pathetic person is an enemy to everyone, even the person who believes in true progress. If anything is right, it is that living a life of “positivity” is the most harmful of all. There is nothing but fake, inauthentic movements that simulate a life. There is nothing but insignificant change in an insignificant life.

The Pathetic person is the more common type of person, compared to the Nihilist and the person who acts in the world in the name of Progress! Most people do not commit suicide. Most people do not “change the world”. Most just sit. The person promoting “positivity” is actually promoting an evil, since they believe life is “worth” something, yet they make zero progress with regards to themselves and others. It is an utterly inconsistent worldview. Either admit everything is Nothing, or do something. What are we to do? I am not sure, but I can tell you it’s not sitting around talking about celebrities. It’s not eating overpriced garbage. It’s not possessing the next shiny object. These are all consequences of the positive thinker! Optimism, which is seemingly the true sort of positivity, only seems to work as an ideal, not a reality. This makes it impossible to actually _be_ an optimist. One must be discontent with their situation to act. Comfort is the product of positivity, and positivity is the stick in the spokes of progress. One must either commit or lay still. These are the options. The Nihilist will not “stand in the way” or cause any unseen hurdles, like the Pathetic person does. The world would be “better” with more nihilists in it, with people unable to act, unable to move, unable to harm.

Why is everyone so calm within their mediocrity? I want to be exceptional at something, anything. I am not happy being mediocre.  Chopin, Nietzsche, etc., these people are exceptional. It’s almost that they are unaware of it though. They most likely never doubted themselves. They probably never doubted their work, their writings. I wonder why I distrust my thoughts as much as I do. Well, I know why I do. For the same reason that I distrust the thoughts of everyone else. They may make sense, but their thoughts do not _move_ me. I read them, I understand them (I think), but I am still who I am. They are Nothing. They are all too serious. I wonder if exceptional people, regardless of their god-like talents, envy others. If they don’t, then they can’t understand what I feel. I feel limited. Restricted in a way that a “smart” person is not familiar with.

Everyone is so content in the most transparent way. Admit this, then come panic with me! We can calm each other down. It _might_ be alright. But until people want to talk about their _fundamental_ existence, this world will always be what it is. I don’t want to hear about a job, or even something you enjoy. You should enjoy what is Good, if you truly believe in Progress. If not, please stop talking. Please, leave me be.

Everyone takes whatever they are doing seriously, but not necessarily what everyone else is doing. Opera singing is nothing but loud screaming. Why do people make fun of the loud screaming in Metal music? One is romantic and elegant. Proper attire is mandatory to attend a concert. The other, the complete opposite. I don’t like the kind of beings that we are, the kind of existence this is. It’s too strange to even be enjoyable.

Ayn Rand was once asked what came to her mind when she looked up into the sky at night. She responded that she didn’t care to look at the stars and that she would rather look at skyscrapers. Rand was an awful idiot.  Yet, she proclaimed her philosophy as if it was _the_ truth.  I don’t understand this type of “confidence”.

[Dec**3**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/03/1130/ "December 3 2015")

Sam Harris once described the “worst of all possible worlds” as a world where the worst human suffering was actual. He said that if you did not think that you could “improve” upon this world, or if you didn’t think that this world was “bad”, then he did not know what you were talking about, and MORE IMPORTANTLY, he did not think this type of person knew what they were talking about. I almost found this convincing at one point. It seems so obvious that the “worst possible world” is bad, doesn’t it? It’s just true by definition, right? Well, I now read the sentence “worst possible world” as “possible world”. I should not get mad at laughter from people’s reactions to me. Their reaction is partially correct, although I do not think they know exactly why they are laughing. My experiences and my reactions to them are valid, yet not even possibly true (since Truth does not exist) on Nihilism. **I must be content with coherent, yet, strictly speaking, false beliefs.** I just experienced why Harris is wrong. The feeling, I cannot quite put into words. Maybe something like this: I always used to be anxious, nervous in particular situations, etc. but never was I conscious of “why” I felt the way I was feeling. I am now aware, and it makes a lot of sense. _This_ is the logical experience to have, once you become aware. I cannot really take anything seriously. I just became aware of being aware. Just when I thought I was aware, this happens. It’s not a “new” experience, it’s a new “awareness” of the same old experience. Why did I always have so few friends? Why did I find social interactions always so overwhelming and strange? It’s because everyone is so casual about what puts me into a panic. It’s always been everything I see, everything that I cannot make sense of, that _cannot_ be made sense of, that has led me to this sort of experience. Under Nihilism, the strength of my experiences makes no sense to me, in any way. No person should feel what I feel (well, they may have similar experiences from different perspectives, which may result in the experiences bringing on sensations of joy instead of pain). This is not a joke, this is not a laugh, this is the worst any person could feel. Would I rather have physical pain (I do have physical pain), i.e. be tortured, compared to this? I am not sure. The panic that I experience _seems_ rational. My panic is not over The Human, it is because I am human. Regardless, no one should feel what I feel. This sort of experience is quite strange on a meaningless world. **How could blind forces create such vivid, terrifying sensations?** How is _this_ even possible. I am not looking at my experiences “on a scale”. I am saying that my experiences “ought” not to even be on the scale, they should not exist. But they do exist, here they are. Is the “rationality” of my experiences _worth_ something? **When I am feeling what I feel and I talk to anyone who is “casual”, it heightens and worsens the experience. It’s like someone chatting your ear off about stubbing their toe as you and they are about to tumble down the Niagara Falls in a barrel.** Either we are safe, on solid ground, and I am crazy, or we really are about to go over the edge, which seemingly make my fears, panic, and anxiety justified.

Am I just lazy? Why should anyone have to do anything they do not want to do, simply to exist? Why is this? Maybe I am simply asking why I have to survive in the way that I do survive. Why do I or anyone else have to do things that they do not want to do in order to exist? “Hard work” is the Value, ha! I do not want _things_, I want rest. Everyone is fake.

Why are you complaining? And, more importantly, why are you taking those “complaints” seriously? You don’t feel what I feel? No? Then _never_ complain. What is it like to be conscious, even predict, your breakdown? What is it to live, to fully experience, your deterioration? I am attempting to tell you.

Here’s the “problem”- I don’t see a difference from the “worst possible world” and any of its infinite amount of ways to make it “better”. It is _this_ experience combined with the fact that I believe that I know what I am talking about that becomes overwhelming. I feel that I understand what I am talking about. The best part is, I understand it so much, that I can agree that I am “crazy”. _**I am**_ _**crazy over true beliefs in a world with no Truth.**_ Ha! I am aware of what is happening to me and around me. My “defenses”, whatever they were, are down. Whatever piece of software it is that stops a person from realizing the world, the universe, as it is, and our relation to it, is defective. That part of me is broken. It rushes in uncontrollably. Yet, I know these thoughts are stupid and pointless. So, even with, say, medication, I will be aware of my defect. I will be aware that my “calm”, my “casualness” is misguided.

I don’t know what to do. This is no longer a “game”. I have come to the logical conclusion of my worldview.

# [11/29](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/1129/)

[Dec**1**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/1129/ "December 1 2015")

I was right about a “regular” psychologist not being able to help me. I know what I am feeling is not necessarily “wrong”.  Maybe a tad “extreme”? Or maybe it’s not, I don’t know. But if a psychologist is not trained in discussing existential or moral questions, like the philosopher is, then the psychologist will not be prepared for what I have to say to them. They will not understand. I do not want to have to teach them philosophy, in order for them to help me. I do not have the patience for this.

I need to make a list of “issues” that I have-

1. My _extreme_ self-doubt/self confidence and how much they waver.

2. Moral Nihilism- people may not be the ultimate cause, but they are my constant reminder of the nihilism. Human beings seem to have been “constructed” without Morality in mind. Maybe “survival” or some other cause, but not for Morality. That people can let other Humans suffer under a “jewelry” billboard shows the kind and “amount” of defect we were “built” with, which eliminates all possibility of morality and meaning.

3. I did not ask to be created. I don’t understand why I am here, nor what I am supposed to do, in the most fundamental sense. I do not want the “excitement” of creating my own life. I did not ask for that responsibility, I did not ask for that “gift”. I’d give it back, if I could. I loathe how CASUAL everyone is about the most important questions. Their casualness is proof that there is nothing. Why would you ignore or not be interested in EXISTENCE, in YOUR existence? What kind of being is not interested in their fundamental existence (not in the “human” or “everyday life” sense)?

4. Elimination seems like the most reasonable solution to this, if the situation is not bearable. I need to get into a “bearable” situation. Is a “bearable” situation even possible? Will I find Meaning or Delusion? I think delusion. If this is true, then how do you live with knowing you’re deluded? Awareness of your delusion equals Nihilism.

5. The “rationality” of contradictory beliefs or systems, e.g. atheism and/or theism being both epistemically justified. The problem of “disagreement”.

6. The idea that #5 “points” in the direction of Nihilism. Why would everything be “unsolvable” in meaningful world?

7. The reasons for not being able to live a nihilistic (subjective value/purpose/meaning) life/the contradictions that arise from Nihilism, e.g. the demands, yet illusion, of moral realism, the idea that most or all people are not “living right” (if a particular purpose does actually exist), it seems that God is needed to save us from Nihilism, yet the “religious solution” does not seem True.

8. My self doubt seems to be stemming from numbers 5,6, and 7. How could I take myself or anyone else seriously when it seems that there is no “right” or “wrong” way? Regardless of “confirmations” or “validations”, I have so much self-doubt. EVERYTHING, whether I take it seriously at one time or another, becomes “stupid”. And not in a trivial sense. Everything becomes completely emptied of any sort of significance. _This_ feeling that drowns everything is what I cannot escape, is what comes “naturally” to me, at any time, during any situation.

9. Philosophy, what I enjoy, has to be a “profession”. I do not want to participate in Distant philosophy. It makes Kant and all the great thinkers look like psychos, since NO ONE knows of their works, nor would care to properly understand them, even if they did know about them. Academic philosophy turns philosophy into a hobby, another thing, among the many things, to do to waste time, again, magnifying the “truth” of nihilism. So either most people are wasting their lives or the “great thinkers” being taught in our schools are the most insane, since they would be speaking about nothing like it was something!

10. My experiences. My experiences are so real to me.  “Overwhelming” is not a strong enough word to describe it.  My entire journal is one big description of my experiences, yet they don’t even come close to what I actually experience.  They are “Religious” in the fullest sense of the word, though not theistic in nature.  The exact opposite, in fact. It does not seem to make much sense that such experiences could even exist on Nihilism, since it seems weird that a “blind force” could create such robust and vivid experiences.  Further, my experiences come with a strong sense of “truth” attached to them, like that of someone who has had a True Religious experience. Both of these types of experiences, which are, in a sense, the same kind of experience, lead to conflicting conclusions (theism/atheism), which seems to be more evidence for Nihilism. But, like many theists, even if all of my “arguments” for nihilism were proven “wrong”, I would still be a nihilist, since my beliefs are grounded in the experience itself.

11. The way I can “compartmentalize” humans and recognize similar behavior that lead to contradictory beliefs. This seems to imply some sort of “faulty wiring” within us. How could that be true, if a Perfect Being is the “ground of all being”?

[Dec**1**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/1124/ "December 1 2015")

The more “knowledge” or “experience” that I have, the more _drastic_ the changes in my perception will be. This is obviously true, since I can say that I am experiencing a particular type of experience now, and I have also experienced the Normal or “negative” counter-part. Does this give any hope? I am not sure. I feel that what I am saying is Eternally True, so there are no “missed moves” here. Is it “worth” experiencing this different perspective that I may have in the future? I am so calm and relaxed right now. It’s funny how I have become accustomed to living in shear panic. Without anxiety, I don’t feel alive. It’s almost boring. “Boring” in a different sense than “meaningless”. ‘

Perfect Nihilism- **_I cannot seem to find anyone else in the world who has thought “this is stupid” concerning the “big questions”._** I cannot find anyone speaking about how stupid it is to even discuss “intellectual” questions. No serious critique, anyway, besides the common deflections that the Non-Thinkers proclaim. Everyone either ignores them completely, in which criticism is not even a possibility, or they are obsessed with them, in either a weak or strong form. An example of The Weak would be passive religion, people who think they really think about the big questions, but are just dogmatic followers. The Strong are philosophers of some kind. Thinkers in general. Scientists and artists are also included here, but still in a weaker sense than philosophers. No wonder I do not fit in any where. _No one is obsessed with a question they find stupid!_ Ha! I am obsessed with something that I find stupid. Has anyone ever had this thought? Is _this_ something dumb? Thinking my thoughts and life are dumb? Is this a possibility for others? It’s to be “given life” by something, and then realizing it’s nonsense. Then becoming engulfed in it again, only to lose interest for no real reason except that it seems “stupid”, and round and round we go. It just all seems so “gay”. Even _this!_ What is _this_ feeling about? To think that all the “great thinkers” are somehow just idiots. The ones who are concerned over the contradictory, the absurdity. It seems like the biggest waste of time. I feel utterly alone, in _this_ feeling.

I don’t really want to do this anymore. It makes no sense. Why do I even care?

I take a quiz about my personality and I get a “pop up” ad when I click on one of the answers? I am concerned for my being, and you advertise to me? I fucking hate you.

I am reading your descriptions. You are not ready for someone like me. I can already understand your analysis. It seems pretty Human to me. It doesn’t seem like they would understand my fundamental problem, my experiences. I am not sure I could even describe it to them. _My journals are one_ _long_ _description._ $225 an hour, huh? I see that you must REALLY care about my problems, since you are charging so much. You need compensation, of course. But my problems are not $225 an hour. _My problems are your problems._ **Maybe I ought to charge you for listening to me!** Ha! I must be a psychologist’s wet dream. So many troubles, so many issues. Let the fun begin!

I find your profiles to be clean, little jokes. They are very funny. You make it sound like you just _know_ it is going to be you sitting around listening to me whine.

One minute you are the joke, the next, it is I! I cannot trust myself, that I am smart or have anything “right”. This doubt is beyond damaging. I need help with my thoughts.

This has become more like “drowning” as of late. It’s been very overwhelming. I am crazy or my life is (and cannot be anything but) a big sham. I _still_ do _not_ see a middle-ground for myself. Convincing? I am not sure that is possible at this moment. “Light Depression”. That you would even use this term shows me you have nothing to share with me. The depression that I deal with cannot have anything in common with “Light Depression”. To call it “depression” is completely misleading. If you want to say that a pair of roller-skates is similar to a Rolls Royce since they both have “four wheels”, then fine, those people with “Light Depression” have something “similar” to myself. There are precursors that lead one _into_ depression. But “depression” is not in stages. This is not something one has and then does not. I may not even be fully aware of it yet. I may think I do, but I am still here. I am not sure how long I could be _here_ with True Depression. It’s too much. Everything is squeezing you, tighter and tighter. The grip is unbearably tight, it’s hard to even breath a normal breath.

But I cannot just sit here. This is not okay, right? I cannot keep doing this. Any of this. Something has to change. If I attempt a change and do not see one, then that’s another story. Confirm or change. Those are the options. My experiences are real to me. All the craziness is just a perspective, but it’s me. I see my craziness, even if you say you don’t.

“Depression and Spiritual Awakening”- A TedTalk. I feel that I disagree with everything she is saying. She is upset because she “can’t have kids”. I find it depressing that she even wants kids. That she wants to bring another Being into existence. Why would you want a thing like that? Because you think that’s what you’re supposed to do? You want kids in order to bring “purpose” into your life?  We need to talk about who is “selfish” here.  Have you ever thought about your existence and what it means to bring something else into existence? This sort of chaos. I can’t seem to find anyone who thinks like me. The “depressed” people don’t sound like me, and the people that are supposed to treat/help them don’t seem to understand me. They seem to take the other people seriously though, which I find extremely strange.

# [11/20](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/1120/)

[Nov**23**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/1120/ "November 23 2015")

Everything is the same, exactly the same. Philosophy is the same as “sport”. It’s a variation of a sport. Philosophy and Action seem to be irreconcilable. If things mattered, then if we could be so privileged (as we are) to discuss philosophical topics, when others are striving to simply stay alive for one more day, wouldn’t we not have to quickly “pass” on such driveling nonsense? Is philosophy just another game? Maybe the “fanciest” of games? Just a trick to keep busy? Is it the “busiest” busy? It would be on the same ground as everything else. I would no longer need to pursue anything. I would collapse. Everything I am pursuing is nothing. My pursuits are no longer pursuits. It’s over. Everything is dead. Nothing is a “shame”. I am not “sorry to hear that”. I am uninterested in everything.

Are these old men, siting in a room, “doing philosophy”, awful people? I feel out of place with them as much as I do any other group or person. I cannot be a philosopher because I do not want to be surrounded by you. I can’t have _this_ feeling and have it be that things actually matter. _This desire for isolation could not be possible in a meaningful world._ I cannot commit to the ethical world (maybe closer to the “religious” world in Kierkegaard’s terms), when I feel what I feel. It is not possible. I may be making a mistake, like the man of seventy years who cannot wipe the ignorant smile off his, painfully obvious, tired face. I am one, single step ahead though. I am aware of my worthlessness. My impossible to avoid mistake of a life. They are content, obviously. They do not even know what to be uncomfortable with!! To think, that humans have to learn to be uncomfortable with themselves!! Ha!! That’s a funny joke. Evolution would seemingly “create” creatures who in their ignorance find bliss. “What’s so bad?” is equal to not understanding the loss of the objectivity of values. You don’t understand the consequences, you haven’t learned what to be nervous about. It was a “discovery” when Nietzsche proclaimed that “God is dead!”. I cannot commit to helping people when their ignorance to everything around them is something that they can ignore. I need to disappear to survive. I need to prepare for an impossible life. No, this is too much work. I can’t do this either. I need a simple life, if any life.

There is a reason that I am so suspect of my own views, and it because I realize my own thoughts or “experiences” invalidate my own feelings. In other words, the worldview I see as being true, makes any beliefs I have meaningless, even my frustration about the world. I am getting upset about nothing. I am getting mad at the football player who runs out of bounds, when there are no boundaries. I am mad about how things could be or should be, if God existed. I am mad because God does not exist? **If my worldview is true, then these feelings I have are strange. They are “real” in a sense, since I am experiencing them, and they are consistent with the world view, but they are silly, at the very same time, since everything is meaningless in this world. So, how could an experience be actual (in that it is experienced by the person having the experience), it’s true about the world (nihilism), yet the reaction of dread or despair that stems from the experience seems “unjustified” in some way, since any sort of “extreme” reaction would only seem acceptable in a meaningful world?** It would almost seem as if my sisters have it right. They would be one step ahead of me. They would be in or just beyond the stage of “acceptance”. Their reactions, would be mildly bothered, disturbed in a very slight way, yet nothing drastic. Still able to move, even if in a minimal way. Is this the answer? No, this can’t be right. Am I just lazy? Am I just making excuses? I feel like I cannot do anything without feeling like a phony. No matter what I do, I feel like a phony. I cannot do anything authentically. I am too lazy to write properly. I just want to stop. I don’t even want this. Maybe some quite will do.

I am still not sure I know the truth. But it seems that it is not gifts, it is not presents, it is not vain compliments. It is commitment. It is an utter saturation of whatever humans can fake of the Perfection. It is not something to be ignored, to be pushed aside. There are NO DISTRACTIONS. There are appreciations. There might be enjoyment in this life, but it is limited. Is it only in the striving of the Perfection of a thing, activity, etc. (A similar idea to Tillich before even reading him?)? That we _consciously_ become distracted. Since this distraction is still inclined towards Perfection. They may be OUR things, human things, but they are attempts at perfecting our things, and only true perfection is in the Perfect Being, in God. This would put worth into the things we do. We would not have to “thank God” for our efforts, we would have to thank Being for allowing all of our efforts, desires, and hopes not to be in vain!! Of course humans would give praise to God, in relation to them! Of course they would give thanks to God for THEIR good! This thought would seemingly only be true if all things (sport, morality, art, etc.) are all on the same footing, with one not being anymore important than the other. This doesn’t seem to make sense, so it cannot be true then!

Could I put a “positive” spin on everything? Is it as simple as that? How do explain all the awful things around me? I want the True world, but I do not know if it exists. I don’t want this one. How could I be taking things “too seriously” if people are dying for their beliefs? How could I be taking things “too seriously” if people are willing to lose everything they could possibly ever have? How could I be taking things “too seriously” if people are voluntarily opting out of this world that I hate? I cannot take myself seriously since there seems to be this comfortable world that is surrounding me. Everything is so confusing to me. Who could help me out of these thoughts? You cannot help me out of thoughts you cannot fully experience. You could help my human psychology. But am I just human psychology? I feel that I am not. I feel this strongly. My experiences are here with me. Telling me that this world does not matter, yet that I must live like it does. I must help! I must do nothing! I am not simply material! Evolution is responsible for keeping me alive. Supplying me with the drive to move forward, in whatever fashion I can.

The feeling of hanging up the phone, like I simply called to get that recipe. To “sigh” and simply hang up a few seconds later. It shows how my thinking is just another “distraction” or activity. But is it an activity that is aimed at Perfection? Maybe all activities are given their value in the attempt at “perfecting” that activity. No, it can’t be this simple. Remember? Things _are_ meaningful or they are not. _Striving towards perfecting anything, a piece of art, for instance, in the face of suffering, does not seem reconcilable_.

Am I mad because I am just like them? Even WORSE, never mind better, since I am aware and still do nothing!! Maybe I am beyond awful. I most likely am. My mind is too big for my brain. I am smart, but not smart enough. Not smart enough!!!

I am not “crazy”. I am not “wrong”. This is _my_ perspective. Could it be proven wrong? Let’s prove it wrong! I just think everything is so stupid. Not now though. I am feeling rather calm. Or is it “numb”? I don’t know.

My perspective is strange, indeed. Not smart, not stupid. Just a perspective. Is my perspective closer to the truth? Does that question even make sense?

The Nihilistic perspective is overwhelming due to its Truth or its ease?

Why can this Muslim man be so sure, without reservation? Just blatant hubris. His knowledge cannot be greater than mine, his experiences cannot be more vivid or robust than mine, yet he acts in the world, while I am paralyzed. Strange, indeed.

# [11/19](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/194/)

[Nov**23**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/194/ "November 23 2015")

_I would be happy to_ _truly_ _believe that I knew as much as I think others don’t!_ My life is the tightest box I could ever be put in. It’s beyond restricting. I am feeling suffocated due to the experiences I am having. If he “sees” the same things I “see”, how could we both just be making them up?

I need these experiences. I cannot hear the things around me, my inner voice has become too loud. My thoughts are starting to take priority. I am slipping into “super-isolation”. I have cut off most ties to any thing or any one. I am almost only concerned with my thoughts. Is this what Balageur meant when he talked about “always” wanting to write? Maybe I do “always” want to write.

I understand about my expectations now. _This_ feeling is coming from the complete conflict of perfection in comparison to what I “actually” see around me. The chasm is unbridgeable. Of course only _I_ see my experiences. I mean this in this most non-redundant way. No one is “let down” like I am let down with what I see around me. You cannot have my experience, not because it is mine, but it’s mine because it can _only_ be mine. It’s _not_ psychotic. It’s mine. It’s real, so real. Why do I want _this_ to be real? Oh, no. I am doing what I was criticizing others for doing- the  “promotion” of beliefs due to their “truth”, regardless of their “disastrous” consequences. I “look forward” to seeing the Truth. But the Truth produces this? Just another thing that makes me Human, an awful Human. You want the “many-worlds” hypothesis to be true, regardless of the consequences? You don’t want to be around for the time when we can upload your consciousness onto a different set of “hardware”? Well, I want my views to “turn out right” as well, regardless of the consequences. Even though we have come to different conclusions, we have done the same thing psychologically. We have “pursued” in the name of Truth! His conclusions, and almost all others, seem to produce a sort of “movement” or “action” in the world. My conclusions have frozen me into a pattern. _Groundhog’s Day._  I am Bill Murray, in both “meaningless” and “meaningful” worlds! Ha! I almost saw a glimpse of the possibility of subjectivity.  “Anything goes”, in a ‘good’ way?

A nihilist has NO obligation to pursue something or “value” something for its “truth”. Nihilism eliminates this possibility. Therefore, a nihilist who pursues something because he thinks it’s true or for its consistency, is humorously wrong, since she “ought” to do something that simply allowed her to live a “livable” life. Or maybe I am simply trying to find the Truth, and therefore may come up short for some time, maybe indefinitely. Is the response or the “disinterest” of the sheep the best evidence for meaninglessness? I think it is. **That so many people can get through life without a thought in their heads. That this is possible is all I need to know that there is Nothing.** **To promote material things over people’s well-being, that this is even possible, shows that humans are not structured properly.** Everyone is concerned with everything but existence. They are getting through life “fine”, right? It’s not even worth being sad over me. Save it, it’s worthless. Everything is the same. Nothing is good or bad. Nothing is Nothing. There is not even the possibility of “consistency”, since all acts would meld into One act. All actions are one action. All consequences are every consequence. It no longer means anything to be “paralyzed”. _You cannot get married. You cannot have kids. You cannot live any sort of Human existence._

Are people’s “moral outrage” over the refugees even justified when the support for the “sports” that exist in America today, never mind around the world, could end world poverty, probably a few times over? Is someone justified in proclaiming “moral outrage” and to say “the consequence of not letting refugees in to the United States is children washing up dead on beaches”, while not declaring such vibrant and emotional “outrage” for the children that are dying every day, hour, minute because they do not have access to clean water? So, we are responsible for other humans, when exactly? When humans are the cause of other humans issues? But this can’t be true, because to say that we are not responsible for the dying child whose birth is a result of a couple who may be “better off” not having any(more) children, but we are responsible for other humans when they are forced from their homeland or their lives are threatened due to other violent human actions? Am I missing the distinction? Why is this such a big moral issue, while the other is not? Is it because Sport cannot be diminished in any way? Is Sport, Our god, too much to sacrifice for human life? I feel that I cannot take anyone’s “moral outrage” seriously. It’s a joke. Who are you kidding? Your moral outrage cannot be convenient for you. You strip morality of everything when you act in such an arbitrary fashion. You drown my moral outrage. You make Morality impossible, just by the sorts of beings you are. And I am one of you.

# [11/17](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/1117/)

[Nov**19**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/1117/ "November 19 2015")

Muslim children yelling “faggots!”. Religion? Yes, it is. People are worried about keeping the races “pure”? _Skin color, nationality, tradition, etc._ _take priority over the people that instantiate these concepts!_ Concepts reign supreme, “Humanity”, as it is actualized, means nothing. We are Human! Your positively IMMORAL demands reflect how you know absolutely nothing about Morality! This is not the world. This cannot be real. My brain has almost had enough experiences. There doesn’t seem to need to be anymore experiences. The ONLY way my experiences could be false, is if they were all made up. **My interpretation of reality is correct. The only way I am wrong/crazy/delusional, is if I am making everything around me up. Unless I am already strapped into a bed inside of a mental hospital, I could not be wrong. If what is happening around me, if empirical reality is** **actually** **real, in some sense, then I am completely sane. I felt a sense of relief for a second.**

What do I do with this “conclusion”? I understand that my interpretation of reality conflicts with most others, and yet my experiences still seem true to me. That’s very strong. This reality felt “unreal” for a short moment. This felt like a true simulation. Maddening thoughts. Truly euphoric.

I cannot take things “too seriously”? This is a very strange reality. A very peculiar existence. What is the reason for everything seeming so odd? Maybe because this is not our “true” existence? No, these are “lofty” thoughts that go against everything I experience. My experiences go against Purpose, yet Purpose is proclaimed by all. The intellectual task of theism is no match for my experience. Very funny. VERY FUNNY. Of course Craig wouldn’t allow any sort of evidence or argument to diminish his belief, since his belief is ROOTED IN THE EXPERIENCE. Certain things, that he sees around him (philosophical proofs, science, religion, etc.), seem to affirm or make sense under his experience, but these evidences are not the grounding of his belief. My experience is the same exact thing. _My experience_ _just is_ _the perfect negation of the believer’s.  My “religious” experiences are beyond true. I am as crazy as any other person who has had a similar experience as mine, regardless of_ _whether_ _the experience_ _is_ _theistic or atheistic_ _in_ _nature. I have arguments for why I think the world is meaningless, I think they are more plausibly true than not. However, even if someone “showed” me that my arguments were fallacious, I would not be able to stop believing what I believe, since the grounding of my beliefs are in my experiences, not my arguments. Things around me “make sense” under my worldview, not theism. My experiences therefore seem more real to me. But, even though I have not had the True Religious Experience, I can only imagine that theistic minded individuals must have had the same type of experience that I have. What kind of universe do we live in where I can have_ _the_ _“One-type” of experience, and know what it feels like to have the perfect negation of this experience, without really having the negative experience? I know what a religious believer feels now. I am “born again”._ This is not small. This is it. But I have the same “experience” as a Believer, with two different sets of conflicting propositions that are put in the same “order” or “path”, that lead to two separate conclusions, one theistic and one atheistic. This is a very strange, yet **distinct** structuring of the human mind. What is the cause of this? What could that mean? It couldn’t mean God created everything, since my experiences are “real” and they negate His existence. But could it mean that nihilism is true, yet somehow there is this odd structure of the human mind that leads to two conflicting conclusions from the same “process”? That would be a very strange coincidence. **Why would the mind want to be able to use the same exact structure to come to two conflicting conclusions?** Is this only possible on a naturalistic worldview? Is there any point to a human being able to have the exact same feelings and experiences about two conflicting sets of propositions, that both lead to conflicting conclusions? Everyone is confident, this is why they take _this_ experience as true.  I understand why you act the way you act, what you do what you do.  If you felt what I felt, then you would also believe what you were experiencing was true. But _this_ experience is leading us to all different types of conflicting conclusions amongst all of us.  Again, this is more evidence for Nihilism! It’s also impossible to put this experience into words.  This “mystical” experience is something intense that seems to happen in the brain, but because of our Human influences, our world around us, molding us into the Person we become, we all interpret the experience differently.

This is why it’s said that what I “have” cannot be cured. Take away my “evidence”. This stamp of an experience will never be washed away.

Confirmation! “We need activities! We are bored here. We need to understand what our purpose is here.” Ha! After just a few days? They are yelling for activities! They have Human needs. They want the “good life”. All these selfish desires that you are expressing are the exact same reason why the people that you think are treating you so poorly, are treating you in exactly that way. Ha! The human mind is becoming weak. The defenses against nihilism are at an all time low. This could be dangerous. I could make a prediction, but I’d rather save myself the embarrassment. I wouldn’t take credit for it anyway.

The “miracle” of Life, existence, itself, is not enough. We need activities! _This_ is why everything is meaningless.

Morality has not even gotten off the floor yet. Everyone is so far behind, that it isn’t even worth it. How can I say something like this? Because I am listening to the “worlds” of humans. I am hearing what they are saying, and it’s disgusting. Our brains are worthless. Complete garbage.

I am “seeing” humanity’s knowledge of Morality in the same “structure” as when I “see” someone who just doesn’t know “enough” about philosophy in order to make the conversation “worth it”. I see that your words are too far off the mark for me to even attempt to put in the effort. We would need to go back, too far back, in order for you to be able to even comprehend what I am talking about, never mind contribute something of substance to the conversation. It wouldn’t matter that other people can talk circles around me about a particular this or that. I can see the world, the human world, and “see” it just like I see the loud, ignorant philosophy student.

_When you’re complaining about a parent “not loving you” and using it as an excuse for therapy, then you do not understand what I feel. Question whether there was anything for that parent to even give, then we will have something to talk about._

I cannot write with an empty pen. No ink equals no writing. No morality equals no action. My subjectivity seems to be a very big part of what it means to be Human. You are smarter than me in every way, except _this_ way. This “little” piece of human psychology. Is it as important as I think it is? Is depression the True state of human beings? What is the objective without the subjective? It’s completely worthless. This subjective state seems very important right now. Very strange. What’s even “stranger” is that if morality does not exist, in any objective way, then we can’t help but live inconsistently, since we are doomed to “believe” in moral realism, even when we are “shown” that moral realism is false.  What a strange existence that is.  _**A being who can’t help but act on a falsehood as if it was a truism**!_  Ha!  Is that the funniest or the saddest realization?

Heidegger wrote a notoriously obscure book. He was taken to be one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. He joined the Nazi party. He took part in the world. He took himself and others seriously. He does not feel what I feel. Smart? He was a human. Just a stupid human with more delusions of grandeur.

I wish the extreme, simultaneous sensations of self-confidence and self-doubt, mixed with the contempt and admiration for others, would just go away. Or maybe I don’t.  I don’t know.

My feelings are here, regardless of “why?”. Some very smart people have called me “smart”. Yet I feel so dumb. Why is this? How could I feel so worthless? Is it because they see the Human and I see the Other? I am “smart”, sure, in your idiotic world, maybe. Your world of arbitrary rules and fictitious games. Your world is stupid, no wonder I seem smart to you, I don’t live in your world. I live in my world, the world in my head. You are just a distraction to the perfection that I yearn for, that I sense in the slightest bit, within my mind. I want to be omniscient. Anything less than omniscient is stupid. You think I am smart the same way that you think “love” matters. You think I am smart the same way you think “anything” matters. I am poisoned too, I do not escape the mess. I am not smart. But, then again, no one is. But are there stupid people? It seems that for me to be smart,  too many people would turn out “stupid”. My “experiences” seem to allow me to produce all these strange types of inductive/Reductio ad Absurdum arguments against myself. **“In order for me to be ‘smart’, too many people, if not most, would have to be considered ‘dumb’, and since it seems crazy to call that many people dumb, I therefore must not be ‘smart’.”**

**My feelings are real to me.** You don’t have to know them or understand them. To the people I like, I don’t even want you to be able to experience this, even though you not being able to experience this is a source for my condition. My feelings are too real. I know I am right, if anything is right.

You don’t get to judge me anymore. You don’t get to tell me what to do. You don’t get to patronize me anymore! You don’t get to go unanswered. Say something to me now. Have a conversation with me now. I am smart. I am very smart. So smart that I know that you’re the reason I need not exist.

The reason that the terrorist attacks in Paris are scary is because people are confused about what is “wrong” about it. People think the killing of people is wrong. Yeah, well, these Muslims don’t. Why aren’t these people right? Because they restricted or took away the freedom or choice from those they killed? Who says we need to value and respect other people and their freedom? The terrorists are so sure that they are “right”. They think they have the correct worldview. How could they think such a thing? These people are so sure. How did they get so sure? They are willing to die for their beliefs? How do you get _that_ confident?  I see everyone, not just extremists, engulfed with this type of confidence and it turns my stomach.  Where are they getting all this confidence from?!

Madonna is crying over the killings in Paris. I have a day off tomorrow. I am planning on going to get a Greek salad. _Everything_ is getting a Greek salad. Wait, you’re not crying because those people got murdered, are you? Oh, you’re upset that the terrorists stopped some people from being able to get their “Greek salads”? I don’t think you’re crying over the correct “tragedy”.  That you’re _not_ thinking _this_ makes me believe that you have lived on this earth for the better side of a century and still haven’t figured out how to think properly.

**T****he Cosmic Accident** would make sense of the actions of people, of the world I see around me. You are the ones who need help. You are the ones who need to “see”. You are blind. Your outrage is so simplistic. You don’t even know what to be upset about with regards to the attacks. You ought to get mad that someone can be so sure that the universe is a particular way, that they know so much more than you. The entire universe screams “meaningless!”. I sincerely hate life. Everything I see around me. It’s all a reminder. Someone talk me out of this. YOU cope with this. You cope with this. You. Try and cope.

“existential depression is pervasive; we cannot escape it.”

“But we cannot overcome our existential depression. All the psychological techniques that cure ordinary depression fail.”

“Some individuals, usually those with substantial initial integration and limited potential to develop, will fall back and reintegrate at their previous level; others find themselves stuck in disintegration—a serious situation that Dabrowski said could lead to psychosis or suicide.”

What I am feeling seems to be confirmed or vindicated in some small way. Philosophy is making me feel this way. The one thing that I am good at, I cannot do, since it makes me feel like death. The irony in this, it’s unreal.

I am reading about existential depression and it IS me. I do not need to type anymore, because I have already written all of my thoughts that fit so neatly into this description of “existential depression”. It never goes away. Camus was right about the absurd, once discovered, it never goes away. What do I do now?

I once asked my philosophy professor if he had ever become “bored” with philosophy at some point in his many years of studying the subject. I _knew_ he was going to answer in the affirmative and give me some great words of advice that would be relevant to my situation, that I would be able to put into action, in order to get my life “back on the right track”. However, much to my surprise, he tilted his head in confusion, and with his condescending smile and squinting eyes, responded- “No, why?” I was at a loss for words. With that answer, I now knew that he would not be able to comprehend the Moral Argument. _This_ awareness, or lack there of in this case, is what makes it impossible for him, and people like him, to understand the ontology of values. It’s just this “simple”.

I see an experience like this as something “more”.  Whether this type of experience is “true” or not, I am not even sure is the correct question to be asking anymore, but I did have this experience.  It’s real to me.  What do I do with this?  If the experience confirms the negative, what do I do?

The Homeless that were huddling under a jewelry billboard. The woman talking to her child in the most stupid way possible, all while grinning at me with a smug sense of satisfaction. Congratulations, you brought something into existence for your sake, your happiness. Keep talking to him like a child, as old as he gets, forever, if possible, and maybe he’ll be lucky enough to stay ignorant. He won’t have to experience what it is that I experience.

To be so casual about things. For the “normal” to be the exact opposite of me is something strange. Yes, madness and genius do seem to go hand in hand. I think what I am seeing is true, not simply a pessimistic spin. Ultimately pessimistic. Schopenhauer at least had egoism!! I see myself in the mess. I am one of them. I am forced to live like them, they make my actions impossible, since through them, I see everything, which is NOTHING. I see nothing because of you. I cannot ignore you. I do not have choices. This is why I cannot ignore everyone around me. You paralyze me. Yes, I blame you. But this “just can’t” be right, since this would eliminate personal responsibility!! Personal what?! There is nothing here. We do what we want. No stops. You hold me responsible in order to take any responsibility off of yourself. You judge me, tell me I am doing something wrong, only because you know you are part of it. You are part of the mess. It is not simply me. If it was just me, I might be happy. Ha! Can I imagine a person-less world with just me in it? I am not sure that I can imagine such a thing, although I think it would be nice to be able to.  _This_ will definitely be misunderstood.

That no one can see MORALITY, if it was real, is the real problem. You don’t even see the “problem” with morality, with life, with the objective! You can’t even begin to understand until you understand that there is a problem! It seems so easily missed. I didn’t even see it until recently. I thought I had been well acquainted with Morality for years, but it was an imposter that I was so familiar with. It was not real morality. **Real morality, ironically enough, is not real!** Ha! That’s why it is so easily hidden! No one can REALLY see it, because it needs to be taught! Is the story of morality just another fiction that “ought” to be taught alongside other works of human literature? Everyone thinks they know Morality. They only know subjectivity. It takes knowing something outside oneself, in order to discover this objective realm. Your cares, desires, family, friends, etc. do not matter because YOU take them to matter. They either matter or they do not. You either don’t know or don’t want to know the answer to this type of question. This question of whether they actually matter or not, aside from what YOU say. A person cannot fathom why or how something couldn’t matter, if that “something” is one of the things that the person thinks matters! To think that “family” doesn’t matter is “psychotic” and will not be tolerated!! It must be an “…illness, he’s not well.” People have such trouble understanding me, because they cannot even experience what it feels like to have nothing matter. “You at least care about _this_, don’t you?” Your question shows your lack of understanding, your lack of feeling. You haven’t experienced it yet. You are still unaware of it. Good for you.

I love the people who laugh at the worst questions like they are simpleton riddles. Why are you doing that? Why does that matter? Why are you alive? Ha! Silly, boy. You’re still worried about these sorts of things? Don’t you know we have moved on from those childish questions?

Moved on? Moved on from what? Where or how do you move without the answer to these questions?

Why am I affected in such a dramatic way, and you are seemingly left untouched? So much so, that I do not want to participate in the same game that you are playing? Debate you? No, it’s not worth it. You are here for points, standing, pride, etc. I am here because I want to know. No confidence here, accept for my total confidence in your incompetence.

This is too much work, if it’s all for nothing. _This_ is stupid, even this. This frustration is from the expectations I have of the world.

It’s not so easy to “revolt”. This makes it seem weaker than it really is. This isn’t something to “revolt” against, simply go play in a soccer game. No, this isn’t possible. **The strength of my revolt would never be enough to beat this.** There are people who play pretend for a living. PRETEND. Life is outside my window as I watch pretend.

That _my_ existence is possible, the kind of existence I live, makes it seem like life is obviously worthless.

What if I come up with ten questions, or maybe just five, and survey some philosophers? Maybe as many philosophers as I want. Some will answer. Most will probably not. But maybe I can see where I stand.

Questions for Philosophers-

1. What do you understand by the term “non-existence” in reference to your life?

2. How often do you think about this “non-existence”?

3. What kind of feeling does it invoke inside of you, e.g. fear, anxiety, depression, excitement, awe, etc.?

4. Do you think about morality and your actions within the context of “being moral”?

5. Do you think you live a consistent moral life? In other words, if you believe in morality, do you find the constraints of such a morality so binding and difficult to live up to that you are forced into living an inconsistent or “immoral” sort of life? By “immoral”, I simply mean that you’re living your life in an incorrect way, whether that’s from delusion, ignorance, etc.

6. Does your answer to question “5” scare you in any way?

7. Would you feel uncomfortable with seeing a homeless man, who is need of simple nutrition, hurting underneath the billboard of a “jewelry” advertisement?

8. Does knowing that question “7” is a reality and that humans allow, whether through ignorance or though maliciousness, “7” to happen have any sort of affect on you? If so, how?

9. Does knowing that humans have allowed for people who pretend to be/ act as teachers in movies, television, etc. are rewarded/glorified more than the real teachers? What does this say about the world to you? Is it okay, since nothing matters, or is it wrong and humans are just not “revolting” due to compartmentalizing this confusing behavior?

10. What makes you doubt yourself? And does your doubt ever have a paralyzing affect on your actions?

**E****xistential Depression/****Psychology**–

_“__Existential Depression.. generally doesn’t affect many people, except in a very fleeting and vague manner._

_“__However, it is extremely prevalent among highly gifted sensitive adults. It’s pervasive, non-specific, numbing and immobolizing — in some cases causing the sufferer to reach a very logical conclusion that it makes most sense to just kill themselves._

_“__It does not respond to drugs or “conventional” therapies for depression; it cannot be “cured,” only “managed” … generally through Existential Psychotherapy..”_

I have had my feelings validated.  This is “good” and “bad”.  The “bad”, like in every other situation, outweighs the “good”.  If anyone understood my thoughts, then they would know why I think this is true.

What am I doing? What kind of existence is _this_? My existence is not an authentic one, I can tell you that much. I pretend to the pretenders. I am just as bad as everyone else. No, they seem a little worse than me. A little, ha! I take it too seriously. Why is that? How is that possible? What is it that I am looking for exactly? What is it I want? I am not so sure anymore. I am tired. I keep getting nauseous from the thought of my existence. Does anyone ever get nauseous of their existence? All human interactions are walking on eggshells. Everyone is so delicate. I want to call you an idiot. I want to say you’re not funny. Why do I have to lie? What if my “judgements” are right? Why am I “rude”, if what I say is true? “You’re an idiot”. I guess you would get mad because you don’t consider yourself an idiot. Blah, I would love for someone to call me an idiot. They would have to tell me “why”, of course. That would be entertaining. Why do others get offended and make me censor myself? Or do I censor myself because I think there would be no one around by the time I was done? Ha!

It seems that Kierkegaard was right. You must make a choice. You must take a leap. There is a “leap” either way. There are seemingly two options: solitude (which equals a slow death) or living as if things are real, morality is real. The problem with the latter is that most people’s actions and thoughts, that I see, negates the possibility of this worldview for me. Everyone is consumed with their happiness. It seems that they think that I am selfish, but in fact they are the selfish ones. I am simply caught up in my thoughts about the grossness I see around me. They are caught up in their pathetic lives. They are keeping busy. A new food, a different vacation, etc. They are selfish. They are fighting off the questioning. You are the selfish ones. Your happiness is achieved only through the suffering of everyone else. According to your worldview, you are the ones who need “help”.

Do you know why everything is a joke? There are television shows that center around perfectly edible food being criticized and picked apart while there are children dying in some parts of the world simply because they do not have access to clean water. You do not like the ‘interpretation’ of the dish of flesh that is being served to you? I wish I could cast you into the wild and watch you starve. There are football players (I am thinking of a particular running back) who play once a week and who have to take a knee on the sideline after their “exhausting” thirty yard run (simply doing their job). Yet they are worshiped like gods and paid millions of dollars all for the name of “entertainment”, ironically by the fools who work 40-50 hours a week for minimum wage. That food, that money, could help alleviate quite a bit of the suffering that is surrounding us. Instead, we need to fight off the nihilism. We must be entertained! If we aren’t, the results will be disastrous. You want to proclaim that certain things are ‘right’ and ‘wrong’? No, you don’t really want to do that. You simply want to pretend. Not only are you not ready for Real Morality, I am not sure that you are even capable of it. How can we enjoy ourselves in the face of the type of “disgusting”? 

I don’t like this.  Any of it.

[Oct**31**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/1026/ "October 31 2015")

I have had no interest in anything. Not even my own thoughts. I am tired of my own thoughts. They are the old friend that becomes annoying by simply breathing the wrong way. I am exhausted all the time. I feel guilt, yet “guilt” is not a justifiable emotion within my worldview. Everything seems obviously nihilistic. We are not all talking about what is going on. We are only concerned with ourselves. Our little world. The Human World. What a waste of time. If this is the only world, then I don’t want it. I don’t even want to write, but I need to _do_ something, anything. I am not doing anything of importance. There is nothing of importance to do! I receive almost no pleasure from anything. I know why I don’t feel anything anymore though. Does this make me different from other “depressed” people? I think it does. I find everything and everyone ridiculous, including myself. Everything is stupid. Everything. How do you survive in a situation like this? It seems ridiculous. This invisible drive, pushing me forward, for no reason. I haven’t studied. I haven’t written. I have barely been able to move. Life’s routine is so strong. It’s like I am in a mold. I hate it.

I can’t remember much. It’s the sense of “confusion” that is so strong. It is all just too weird. So, it seems that either Kant and all philosophers are wasting their time or everyone else in the world, who does not study philosophy, is doing something wrong. This has to be the case, since the two groups are living completely distinct lives. Their existence is different on almost every level. So, are “smart” people just “extra” insane or are they the rare few that are “getting it”? Either way, it’s depressing. Either the smart people being taught in schools are insane, since they are talking for no reason, or the huge masses of people are all wrong, for never thinking properly. _What a shame, for both, either way._ How is everyone not depressed? How does anyone get along? Why does this feeling I have not infect everyone else?

Every conversation outside of my head is pointless. This is why I have no friends. I just want to talk to myself. Every conversation outside myself leaves me riddled with anxiety. I have to pretend, I see everyone else pretending as well, yet it keeps going and going and going…I can’t even study anymore.

You were just told that you have cancer and only 6 months to live. You were living a “good” life and were a “happy” person before hearing the “bad” news.  Now, for the next six months, you _must_ live, in the fullest sense of the word.  Live all you can live.  Everyone you know agrees.  And in an almost nagging fashion, they insist that you “get out there and live!”.  You must experience everything that you can possibly experience.  But there is something a little different about this situation you find yourself in.  Every time you talk to a person, hear someone talk, watch television, etc. you are either told directly by the person you’re speaking to or you will be reminded, in some way, about your cancer and the quickly diminishing amount of time that stands between you and your sleep.  What would you think about this last six months of yours?  Would you be able to actually “enjoy” anything?  What could anything mean to you with this awful news, glaring right at you, like someone holding a flashlight directly into your eyes?  You can’t just “ignore” this, can you?  No, of course, you can’t.  So, what do you do?

This is how I see everything.

The Value of Philosophy- If everyone learned the consequences of theism/atheism, the idea of values, they may live their lives differently. If people actually believed in God in the real way, a philosophical way, as a true reality, then people may stop paying lip service to this god, and actually start acting differently. Or we can just go back to mowing the grass. You know, what’s important.

[Oct**29**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/1017/ "October 29 2015")

How could or why would a Universe create such beings as ourselves, where the consciousness of these beings would relate, in such a way, to the universe as we do?  A perfect example of this would be through our understanding of quantum mechanics and how big of a part “human experience” has over the actual structuring of the universe.  Idealism never seemed right to me.  It seems that it may be true though. Why would particles act like waves? Why would waves act like particles? What?

Moving on.  Back to the nihilism! Why, Seth Macfarlane? Speaking at a presidential rally? Nuclear weapons? Who cares? Is that too much? Maybe _this_ depression, that I think I love, is something that needs to go. Maybe _this_ is too much. It’s too real though still. It still feels like the Truth. Is he smarter than me though? What does he see that I don’t see? Why does he care? Why is he talking? Why is he getting out of bed in the morning? For no _real_ reason? I don’t understand. Who are these people behind him, all excited? How is this possible? Am I in too deep? Am I seeing the truth or am I skewing everything? Fuck, I am tired of not being able to tell. I can’t watch anything. I can’t enjoy anything. _This_ can’t be right. A person enjoying nothing? This must be bad, yes? This is the worst possible situation, mentally? Why is everyone so happy? Am I beyond paranoia? Is what I am saying making sense or is it pure hysteria? Would I recognize craziness if it was here with me now? Is it here with me now, at this very moment? Have I found the breaking point? People do not know what I am feeling. I am seeing everything. It’s too much. True or not? Ha! Will I ever figure this out? This is a True Dilemma. What do I do? What do I watch? What do I say? Who do I talk to? I bet John Searle has never stepped back and thought that what he was doing was ridiculous. THIS feeling, he has never had. The one I have twenty times a day before I get out of bed. “What am I doing? What am I saying? This is all ridiculous.” Searle, I would bet my life, has never said that to himself.

I am sick of feeling the false sense of guilt from the false virtue of humility. Humility, you are definitely not a virtue. You “get through life the best you know how”? Nope. This makes it seem even worse. I need to sleep. Are these guys talking about the ideas the same way I would? Is their confidence false or deluded? Is it just misunderstood, or do they really think that what they are saying is important? Ahhhh! This is assuming naturalism. I am assuming naturalism. I can’t beg the question like that. Can you create consciousness? Is consciousness the same as the heart? If the heart stops pumping, we can recreate something that will beat like a heart. Is consciousness something like a heart, just another “higher-level” part of an organ? No, this sounds nuts. How could these subjective thoughts, these “photos inside my head” _simply_ be neurons firing? It may partly be that. But it seems that it cannot all be _just_ that. Explain my thoughts, my brain, using my differing brain states. This would not seem to produce what is happening in my mind, nor even describe it in a reasonably close fashion. Why would you want to recreate consciousness naturalistically? Why would you want “materialism” to be true? There is no way of telling if “someone is home” behind the consciousness. Ha! Yeah, so, you’re saying that even you are deluded. _The person speaking is telling me that he is deluded. Is this real life? No, this can’t be real life._ This person is enthusiastically explaining away all my subjective, personal experiences like it’s a cancer. How does he get married? Raise a family? Have a meaningful relationship with anyone? How is it a question _if_ he is diminishing the importance of consciousness?! He’s not diminishing it, he’s eliminating it. Destroying it, with a smile on his face. How funny. You hope you’re dead before the technology for a theory that you seem to be “pushing” is around? I am seeing everything with clarity. This _does not_ make him happy. It’s as miserable to him as it is for me. Then why continue to strive? Where does he get the motivation to move?

Why am I concerned with what I feel when I am depressed? _This_ feeling is so real, so true, that I ought to be worried about why I _don’t_ see what I see, or feel what I feel when I am _not_ depressed.

They believe scripture says a particular thing, and they act on it! How can they be so sure that their interpretation is correct? How can people be so sure as to not only act, but truly commit. These people are beheading other people. These people are doing what they think is “right”.  I cannot even be so sure about what I believe that I don’t even want anyone to know my thoughts, yet these people are committing their lives to their beliefs. Crazy. How could someone think that Charles Darwin was lead to his theory of evolution by the devil? How could a person believe something like this, yet have enough confidence to run for the President of the United States? How is that even a possibility? Why doesn’t everyone hear this and freak out? Or laugh him out of the room?

**We cannot be casual about following a set of beliefs that revolve around a dead man coming back to life.** This cannot be life. The people in the suits are fools for wasting their life. The common folk are the ones that don’t take God seriously, which is obvious from their actions. The consequences of Christianity being false are too much to fathom. No one should want to be an atheist for _that_ simple reason alone. The idea that humanity is so far from the truth. Or maybe I can’t know a thing like that. But I can say that if Christianity is false, then the world looks insane. People DYING for their beliefs. People DIE, LOSE THEIR LIFE, for particular beliefs. I cannot motivate myself to get out of bed in the morning, I can barely do anything, but they could die for their false god? How does this happen? This is insane. It’s almost as if there are different worlds within this world.  **Everything is so urgent and so casual at the same time.**

[Oct**29**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/1016/ "October 29 2015")

I am starting to believe my thoughts. This is dangerous. Or it’s possibly dangerous. I used to just think with no particular end in mind. It seems strange that, even if it’s at a snail’s pace, I am making progress in my thoughts. I seem to be leading myself down a particular path. I sometimes feel that I am not in complete control of the direction that I am headed. Religion must be eliminated. People need to discuss “value” in a serious sort of way. I cannot live in this sort of world anymore. Why shouldn’t I believe what I think? Why should I be so skeptical of myself? No one has been able to show me otherwise. My “religious” experiences are as real as me writing right now. Why should I not trust them? Why must I be so skeptical about them? Well, for one, if I am right, then almost everything, everyone, is wrong. What an ugly world we would be living in. Celebrities, unreal. People thinking they are important. People playing “pretend” for a living, setting up award ceremonies to indulge in all their great “works”. Please. Take your sense of entitlement and…

I am either amazing or psychotic. Is there a middle-ground here? I still can’t see it. I want to see it, that might ease things up a bit for me. I feel like I need to be locked up, if what I think is not true. They feel so true to me. So, why do I still doubt them? What if I simply embraced it all and let it just all unfold? No, that couldn’t be right. The decisions, all the decisions, would still be unwelcome. What is psychotic? Well, if my experiences are true, then I am in the clear. If what I think is not right, then I made a very wrong turn somewhere, a long time ago, and have simply moved further and further down the wrong path. The definition of delusion- how could my experiences be false, yet feel so incredibly real to me? More real than almost anything else. If they are wrong, they are the strongest sort of delusion. This is almost overwhelming. It would be the same if someone took a helmet off your head and told you that everything up until now has been a virtual reality that the helmet you were wearing was producing. Nothing was real. Well, nothing would be real for me. I would have to accept that I am delusional. I would have to accept that something is _wrong_ with me. Is something wrong with me? Am I saying things that are _wrong_ or are they simply “taboo”? Are they simply unconventional? Or are my thoughts incoherent? This is maybe why I write things down. So, maybe one day I can find out if anyone can help me out on this idea about “Truth”. Why do I question myself so much, in spite of these “religious” experiences? What is the issue? Stop. That cannot make sense, can it? Why do I have so much doubt, when I have an experience so similar to those who call themselves “religious”? They dictate their life around it. They bring strange creatures that we call “Human” into this ridiculous existence and dictate their lives by this silly notion of religion. Who’s the crazy one? Why do I feel so smart and so stupid at the same time? What makes me feel that I cannot do what any other of these pathetic humans can do? We all have our “unique” traits. I can see no reason for why I cannot be “great” too. Especially with my experiences, I cannot see why I doubt myself when faced with such a transparent figure. Why do I care about offending the people I find idiotic? Why do I even care what _you_ think of me? You’re nothing, and do not even know it! Ha! I, who strives for consistency, may be a walking contradiction himself. Could I possibly just talk with the authority with which I think I have? Absolutely not! I don’t even know enough yet! How can I speak on things I do not know _enough_ about? This makes me pause. Why am I not smart enough? Why do I feel so dumb all the time? I want ignorance.

What did Nietzsche do with his day? Write, then walk? He was just another idiot who was walking around thinking. Who was he? Another simple idiot lost in his delusions of grandeur. I am in good company then. Does this make my worldview even more depressing, since it robs everyone of their greatness, or does it make my worldview more “livable”, since we would all be in the “same boat”?

Which perspective is true here? “More true”, maybe? It’s even frustrating here. Both sides, all the time. Why do I feel so smart and so stupid at the same time?! I’d almost rather just take “stupid” all the time.

I scored a “22” on my “narcissism test”. Celebrities usually get around “20”. Normal people range between “12-15”.

[Oct**17**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/811-2/ "October 17 2015")

There seems to be an impossibility of religion, at least the religions that exist at the present moment. How could anyone believe in a particular religion? If we live our lives by the dictates of a false religion, and God exists, along with a particular purpose for our existence, then the entire human race is being derailed from Truth directly because of that religion. If it is even possible for Christianity/Islam/etc. to be false, no one ought to believe in it. The consequences are so bad, the ideas of Christianity _could_ be so wrong, that they would be unforgivable. The possibility of it’s falsehood is the strongest reason not to believe it. No traditional atheistic philosophical proofs necessary. The problem of evil? I have a different problem, a bigger problem. How about we call it the “problem of error”? To have everything based on a fairy tale, would be sickening. Ideas, values, concepts, _life_ itself would be based around a fiction. Life would be built on a sick joke. This doesn’t eliminate God. This says that it is irrational to believe in any religion, since the consequences of believing in a religion, if the religion turned out to be false, would leave humanity in a state of retardation. A little baby, reciting bed time stories, never able to grow or progress.  This argument is against religion, not God. Imagine people basing their lives off of a Sherlock Holmes novel. Everything would be based off a fiction. You might be the promoter of the biggest lie there is. If atheism is true, then _this_ argument is worthless and we are left with an entirely different set of negative consequences, and a person could proceed, without reservation, to hold to any particular religion they please. But if God exists, and all religions, so far, are false, then there seems to be a very deep problem here. How could you promote a possible (gigantic) lie so easily? This is not about the individual, this is concerning the collective.  The Big picture. This is not simply a concern for yourself.  Your beliefs are not taken in isolation.  Why would you even want to keep a belief that concerns the knowledge of God to yourself anyway?  How is this so _casual_ for everyone? How do people simply baptize their children without any thought about what they are doing? Do they realize they are “protecting” their child from hell?  What do you know about this “hell”?  Nothing?  How do people bring up their children with a “worldview” without any sort of justification for the worldview itself? I would never want to steer someone in that wrong of a direction. Yet everyone is taking the most important question you can ask and “ignoring” it.  _This_ sort of behavior is why I cannot “ignore”.  It’s everything, everyone, everywhere.  Every one says one thing, does another, and does not see the inconsistency.  The actions of everyone point to nihilism.  How can I realistically turn my head away from nihilism when its presence is so powerful?  

If someone on the street stopped you and asked for directions, and you did not know the area, but still give him directions, knowing that they are most likely wrong, or, at minimum, you could not give this person an explanation as to why your directions were right, even though they could be correct by chance, wouldn’t this be considered immoral in some way? It seems that it is. But then, if I don’t know Christianity is true, and the negative consequences of preaching such a lie are so negative that they are seemingly beyond a full comprehension, then it seems more reasonable to withhold judgement to a particular religion, than to adhere to this religion with full passion, dictate one’s life around this religion, hold to an afterlife (ha!), pollute ones metaphysics, etc. No? The very possibility of doubt allows for the negative consequences to “win”, take over. Religious people are stuck in the dilemma between the atheistic meaningless world and the world of possibly adhering to the biggest lie ever told (people dying, killing, etc. over these beliefs).  What an awful situation.  

Am I just regurgitating the problem of religious diversity? Is what I am describing the “Dogma” of the type that Harris and others were rallying against? It seems more than that, since these atheists are too dismissive (or even unaware) of the proofs for God or the implications of atheism. It seems that what I am saying is more than this. What I am talking about is not that different religions maintain conflicting claims amongst themselves, but rather that if any of them are wrong, then this has the horrible consequence of billions of people, for thousands of years, having structured their lives around a lie, a fairy-tale. Is what I am thinking similar to C.S. Lewis and his “Trilemma”? Lunatic, Liar, or Lord? Jesus is simply immoral if he is not who he says he is. He is definitely _not_ a great moral teacher, if everything he says is based on a lie, if he is not, in fact, God. Truth or pragmatism- this goes for all religion. _The success of religion inside the individual, if I am right about the overwhelming consequences of the religious belief being false, cannot justify the religious believer on self-gratifying benefits alone since all “benefits” would seemingly fall under the category of an illusion ._  If C.S. Lewis was right, and I am right, then the pragmatic justification of religion would be _impossible_. The outcome of pragmatic justification for religion would be to say that it is okay to base one’s life around a lie. Is your subjective comfort worth basing the entire foundation of humanity on a lie?  It’s not- “how do you know which religion is true?” It’s- “what if a particular religion is false?” And if your religion is possibly false, then maybe it might be better not to lead humanity down the path of a lie?  **_Apologetics is forced to flourish. The arguments do matter!  Philosophy does matter!_**

 Is this just a _reverse_ Pascal’s Wager? No, it seems more than this too. It’s not that if you pick the wrong religion, you may go to hell or suffer some other description that is grounded in religious belief. Rather, the problem is that if you believe in the wrong religion, and _there is some purpose to life_, then you have just lived life the wrong way.  And every one around you, before you, possibly after you, will have lived the wrong way too. Does this have a necessarily paralyzing effect on all of our actions? Would this argument freeze everyone? Is it too restrictive? Does a person just have to make this Leap of Faith? Is this the problem that Kierkegaard was talking about? It has nothing to do with different religions having conflicting beliefs.  Even if the world had only one religion, we may still have this problem. It also has nothing to do with any sort of moral issues that stem from a sort of “egoism” or “unjustified hubris” in the sense that you believe that a religion is true in the face of others, some of these “others” who are very intelligent, believing in a conflicting religion, or no religion at all. This _isn’t_ what is immoral about believing in religion. It isn’t irrational because of the fact of epistemic disagreement. Sure, some people believe P while others believe ~P. One can seemingly be rational in holding particular beliefs, in the face of people holding to the negation of your beliefs.  However, it would not be rational to adhere to something with such immense consequences as I believe the falsity of religion entails. Religion is an “answer” to all of the deepest questions that a human being can ask themselves. This is not a simple, _casual_ choice.  

Again, this would _not_ shut down the concept of God. This would _force_ the conversation about the Ultimate Reality forward. Instead of interpreting a religion, taking it as Truth, then molding it to reality, let’s, rather, just talk about reality. Let’s not shackle ourselves with the doctrines of religion. Let’s not find religious doctrines untenable or “irrational” and as a result, reject all concepts of the Ultimate Reality. This is so wrongheaded. Everyone must see this. This does _not_ deteriorate God into the “spiritual”. This does not diminish God into the obscure, removing the possibility of theological progress. Rather, it frees us to talk, openly, about our situation, both naturalistic and metaphysical. “_Something_ like God…” is found within these religions. Failed conceptions. We can learn from these conceptions, but we cannot trap ourselves within these conceptions. Is this “problem” a problem for all knowledge? Is this argument too skeptical? Is it too demanding? Why doesn’t everyone see the ridiculousness that would come from believing in a false religion?  Why is everyone so _casual?_  To put it another way, how is everyone so confident?  The “doubt” that these believers in Religion speak of is so foreign to me.  It’s not the doubt I am speaking of here.  This is paralyzing doubt, not a shrug of the shoulders and “we’re off!” type of doubt.  

**A person believes in god, maybe unknowingly, to fight away the consequences of an atheistic worldview, but knows deep down, on a second level, that theism is false, therefore does not discuss God, except on a very superficial level, since any discussion of this god may be the equivalent of finding out that the baby’s bottle is filled with poison. Shops, sports, keep busy, don’t think, live life, etc. This explains my surroundings. Everyone has nihilistic tendencies and, moreover, actions, yet claims to believe in God at the same time. God is the cure for nihilism.  God possibly saves us from our biggest problem, yet we don’t want to discuss it due to the fear of discovery that our solution might be wrong.**  

The atheistic feeling I get is “religious”.  It fits all the criterion that James gives to mystical experiences.  Yet, my experiences seem to lead me to the complete opposite result of the “typical” sort of mysticism that James describes.  _I cannot ignore everyone because everyone makes everything so clear._  If I ignore idiots, then I am left with a feeling of “deluding” myself.  I am left feeling strange.  I cannot just ignore everything around me.  This would be a strange sort of existence.  What kind of life is a life of ignorance on that scale?  Again, when I see people, I see a strange thing.  I don’t understand if what I am seeing is completely right or completely wrong.  It seems so right.  But if it is, then it’s really bad.  It’s awful.  The Feeling I get, that I have, it’s so strong.  It’s not always there though, which makes me think that I am “making it up” in some sort of way.  Maybe I am skeptical about my “religious” experiences in a way that a person who has had a “true” religious experience ought to be skeptical.  I mean, I could go around shouting, with certainty, that “nihilism is true!” (Ha!) or that “God is dead!”, but I am not sure, even though my experiences are telling me that what I think is true.  _Isn’t it crazy for a believer to take his or her experience as far as they do?_ I am confused on what to do _because_ I do not know which worldview is true. These people, if they weren’t so sure, wouldn’t bring their children up in a particular religion. I feel like life isn’t real. Have you ever overheard a conversation? Have you heard what is being said? Do you not feel it when you overhear a conversation? It feels like two worlds. My world and the rest. Even people who “agree” with me (or maybe it’s I that agree with them) don’t really understand it. As far as they go, they didn’t get to this feeling. They almost did. Well, maybe I am just thinking of one person. Kierkegaard. He was so close. He was still as delusional as anyone else though, even though he understood everything, seemingly, perfectly. What’s this extra “feeling” that I have? Where does it come from? Is this simply the consequence of an ultra-pessimistic filter? _Is this filter giving me true beliefs and/or experiences?_ That’s all I need to know. Since they are polar opposites, it’s one or the other. Either _all_ of my experiences are warped or they are a proper description of what I see around me. _This is so important._ If my “religious” experiences are true, then I am normal, and need to cope in whatever way that I can. _I can live with consistency, without guilt, without regret._ However, if I am wrong, then I am crazy. Depression would therefore be a disease that would need to be eliminated. The glasses would need to be cleaned, I can’t see anything. If I am wrong, then I am completely blind. I am so far off that it’s embarrassing. Oh, no. This is my own argument from above. If what I argue above is true, does it lead to me not being able to hold my views rationally? Oh, no. _My view is possibly false. My experiences are possibly false, so I have no epistemic reason for holding them in such a passionate, life-altering, all-encompassing way. A weight can be lifted. I may be wrong though._ So, do I look at the pragmatic reasons? If there are good reasons to believe in theism (broadly construed, stripped of doctrine), and the opposite view, my view, may be false, then because it is pragmatic to believe in theism, since it would positively effect my life, then I ought to see pessimism as a disease, rather something I actually want.  But what does “positively effect my life” even mean?  If things are good with God, then why aren’t they still good without God? What are they robbed of?  _This_ is the positive conception of an experience.  I felt “free” for a second.  Almost like something was sucked out of me.  Just for a second though.  I can still feel the remnants of the experience, it’s fading rather quickly.  It almost feels energetic, even though I am extremely tired right now.  Is _this_ the feeling people get when they hear some of the things I think about on a daily basis?

If atheism is true, everything I see, everything I experience is correct. This is a bit much, since it would seem that so many people are wrong or at least inconsistent. Why do I even care about this? Why do I have to stress and think about these things? Everything is too much. I don’t even want to do _this._ Everything is so tiring and stupid. I am figuring it all out and figuring nothing out at the same time.

If theism is true, then everything I see may still be correct. It’s not important which worldview is true, right now, it’s about the way in which everyone is acting and it not being in accord with what they say they believe. It’s the inconsistency of their behavior. Or maybe it’s just the dullness of the world. How ridiculous is the human brain, that my stupid brain, can think that the universe, whatever that even consists of, the billions of light years of distance, the possible multi-verse, etc., is boring? “This is all boring!”, I proclaim!! Ha! What a joke! How could all of this be boring? I am as stupid as the next. My brain must be messed up. Even if everything I think I am seeing around me is a certain way, knowing that looking up in the sky, then being able to sincerely proclaim that I am “bored”, brings out the utter nonsense of the human brain.  The concept of “Boredom” ought to be enough proof that life is meaningless.  What a stupid existence this is. I am supposed to take a creature seriously who can get bored? What kind of god could create a being such that it could be surrounded by the complete craziness that the universe is and proclaim to be bored? This is nuts. I have nothing to do? What do I fill my day with? _Why would a god create beings that would exist in the middle of a (literally) universal size fireworks show and still get overwhelmed with boredom?_ What kind of sense does that make? Is boredom the strongest delusion? Aren’t all the activities that humans have made up the actual illustration for why everything is meaningless? Are we not shooting ourselves in the foot here? The more activities, the more things we invent, the more contingent things that we want, the stronger the feeling of meaninglessness should be creeping up on us. What are we doing this for? Why are we inventing that? For what reason? Why are we staying alive? For what, exactly? This feeling I am having at this very moment is either right or wrong. There isn’t any middle-ground here, at least none that I can see. _**I am either right and everything around me is insane. Or I am wrong and I am insane.**_ Go ahead, laugh. I know, you think that’s funny. You don’t feel what I feel. I feel I would normally get mad at someone who would try to say to me what I am saying right now! Ha! Why does what I say stand, but for others it does not? This is fun. Are you having fun? It’s a strong delusion, if it is a delusion. So strong. Unreal. But, then, maybe I am right! Ha! Here we go again…

I wish I never studied philosophy. Would I have been as miserable? Knowing me, I most likely would. Ha! Miserable. It feels like I am one of the very few who are not crazy, yet everyone probably thinks I am crazy. That is very confusing. And seemingly a thought that a madman would say. Maybe I am mad. Or maybe if someone could explain everything I see around me, then I would be okay. Just explain _everything_, because it’s all weird to me. Ha!

I want to stop writing and I want to keep writing. I want to show this to everyone and no one. I want this to be mine, but I want to express my ideas so that they can be evaluated. I need an evaluation. But they wouldn’t understand. **They would put “names” onto symptoms I have, they would not** _**understand**_ **the feelings I have.** Yeah, depression. Sure, anxiety. But are “labels” the sorts of things that are called for in this situation? Am I completely right? Or am I so far away from the truth? Help me? Maybe you are the one who needs help. Maybe you are the one that is missing everything. I am not _even_ wasting my time. I am just here. I just exist. That’s all. _Nothing_ more. I am going to write until I feel the sense of importance dissipate. Ha! Delusions of grandeur. But everything I am saying is exactly what I need to say to stay sane, or else I am in another world. I am speaking nonsense or possibly not. **There are at least two different worlds.** **Two worlds within my own head.** I get caught up in life too, in the wrong ways, which makes me just as awful as everyone else. Two things: my position is just as weak in that I can’t hold to it with such passion or certainty, and I get sucked into this life sometimes, sucked into the human life, a life with both too much concern for ourselves and too much self-deprecation, which takes me from my other world. So, which one is true? I get pulled back and forth between worlds, and I can’t tell which is real. It’s like getting sucked into a black hole and ending up in the other world, and then back again, over and over.

The point is that I am either right or wrong. It’s laughable how both options seem to be true to me. I have good reasons to suppose either of them true. To the outsider, I understand this seems like a false dichotomy, and that you are going lean towards the “crazy” explanation. However, I’d like to think that what I am saying is true. My experiences either mirror the world with immeasurable precision, or they are so deluded that I ought to be locked up and looked after. Black and white. No in-between. All or nothing. Which one is right?  It seems that for theism and atheism to both be rational leans in favor of atheism being true, but I do not feel like explaining why.  Lazy philosophy.  You should just know that the rational possibility of theism and atheism lends itself to an atheistic world.  If you do not know why, then I will not explain.  You will not understand me anyway.

You get brought into this life ignorantly, on both your part and theirs, and when you ask “For what?”, they get concerned for you!  Ha!  That’s the best joke I have ever heard.  “Why did you have me?  Why did you bring me into this?”  There is something “wrong” with _me_ for asking this obvious question?

[Oct**7**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/107/ "October 7 2015")

Someone here has it all wrong. One of you is speaking with such confidence and assurance, yet couldn’t be more wrong in any way, ever. So, who is it? Knowing that one is completely wrong, or both are wrong, makes the whole thing sickening. Truly nauseating. Sitting there, in front of the camera, preaching/teaching utter nonsense…maybe. Ha! How do we live with that sort of disagreement? How is everyone so _casual_ about some people talking complete and utter nonsense? Speaking about something and being so wrong that it’s embarrassing. _**If we only knew who was right, we could lock the others up in a psych-ward.**_ Ha!  That’s how _crazy_ this is. Some of the population, maybe most, or even all, have it wrong. Assume atheism or theism is true, but obviously not both. Assume theism is correct. We are talking about millions of people (atheists), that are spewing utter nonsense about reality. This is scary.  To be that wrong about something so fundamental. It sounds even worse if atheism is true. Because now we have a ton of people, walking around talking about an imaginary reality. An imaginary being. An entire made up “afterlife”. I mean, we are talking about a lot of made up nonsense, if theism is false. Does it not scare you, even a little, that you are standing next to someone who may be holding completely insane, made up ideas? Are these ideas rational though? Would that make it less scary? Yes, I think it would be okay, if the belief was rational, in some sense. _What’s scarier: the blind faithful or the sophisticated theist?_ The blind faithful are maybe believing in the biggest lie ever told, without even truly considering the question, in any sort of adequate way. **On the other hand, the sophisticated theist is a person who has devoted his life to a complete lie. A total sham. Isn’t that insane? To base a life around a complete joke? _Is that not the saddest illustration of a possible consequence of the human condition?_** Especially since the sophisticated theist is someone who obviously believes in, and values, Truth, yet she got it all wrong. That’s depressing. We are all, maybe, standing next to a psycho. I would define a lie of a life that deep as psychotic. I don’t mean the moderate religious believer here. I mean the extremists, on both sides. The theist who thinks he experiences God may be scarily wrong. The atheist may think he is being rational, but he is simply denying all kinds of common sense conceptions, e.g. the principle of sufficient reason, in order to avoid this God.  A.C. Grayling, you joke, how are you a respected philosopher? Acting like you know what you’re talking about. You are lifting up humans, taking us beyond God? This task is absurd and impossible. So confident that everything can come from nothing, for no reason, for no purpose. When I heard you speak, talking with such authority, when I would say that you have no idea what you’re talking about, made me feel a little better about myself. Your “refutation” of the cosmological argument was something a freshman, taking his first course in philosophy, would come up with.  This made me feel a bit of comfort. If you’re allowed to say such foolish things sometimes, then so am I.  You’re a talking idiot dressed up in suit. Ha!

Mathematics is supposed to be necessary, a priori knowledge. Is it simply a strange coincidence that the universe is describable in necessary, a priori terms? How could that even be possible? That seems insane. A rational, mathematical universe that conscious beings can observe and describe? That is insane.

[Oct**7**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/106/ "October 7 2015")

Is atheism a new faith? Does atheism entail having faith? What is faith? The atheist seems to believe that “faith” is “belief without evidence”. I don’t think this definition of “faith” is correct, but let’s put that aside and assume this particular conception of faith.  The atheist always vehemently denies that faith plays any part in their epistemology. I used to be one of these types. However, after some thinking (Ha!), atheism does seem to be a faith, in the sense that it seemingly lacks justification for some fundamental beliefs that the atheist wishes to affirm. These are beliefs that pertain to morality, existence, mathematics, consciousness, rationality, etc. All of these fundamental beliefs are seemingly adhered to without, I would argue, any proper justification.

There is a confusion. A distinction must be made. “Faith”, for some atheists, doesn’t pertain to the belief about God’s non-existence, since some atheists give arguments for the rationality of atheism (these can be both good and bad arguments). If the atheist has good arguments for God’s nonexistence, then there isn’t any need to invoke faith. If the atheist does not have intellectual reasons, but maybe instead disbelieves in God for emotional reasons, then it does seem to become a faith claim. There seem to be “right” and “wrong” (rational and irrational) ways to be an atheist in the same sort of way that I think there are “right” and “wrong” ways to be a theist. Faith may still be the “enemy”, since religious doctrines or claims, not God’s existence, are what seemingly require faith. Unless “faith” is something that is seen as “non-cognitive” (?). By “non-cognitive”, I mean a form of commitment to the arguments and evidence that you have, a way of living one’s life, a way of seeing the world, that are held due to there being good reasons for believing the particular worldview to be true.  But this is too much…

There is a particular brand of atheism that requires faith.  The kind of “faith” that atheists have, whether they know it or not (and they usually aren’t aware of it) stems from their naivety surrounding the “death of God”. The death of God is not something the atheist can recover from without a little help from the concept of faith. “I don’t have faith that there is no God…” Sure, that’s fine. But the universe, combined with the death of God, becomes a very strange place. The universe becomes a place where the atheist lacks a justification for many fundamental beliefs that they wish to affirm.  Where or how does an atheist ground morality, rationality, existence, etc.? The atheist does need justification for these sorts of beliefs, since the theist does have a plausible account of these fundamental beliefs. I take these arguments or accounts that the theist puts forth to be rather strong (more plausibly true than not) and the atheist (whether admittedly or not) seems to agree in most areas. There are, for example, some atheists who are moral nihilists, those who deny objective morality. These are not the atheists that need to be “saved by faith”. _I am talking about the atheist who wants to reject a religious god, yet maintain the foundations that the theistic framework has put into place_. Atheists think that while rejecting this religious god, instead of following the arguments that plausibly lead to God, they can still justify all the beliefs that belief in God entail. Atheists, even if the arguments are not compelling, they are strong enough to have been talked about for hundreds of years (this is not a great argument, but, hey…). The refutations you have provided are weak, at best. What are you waiting for? I thought we were the “Party of Rationality”?! If what I am saying is true, then this forces the atheist into a position of actually defending their view, providing reasons for holding beliefs about morality, rationality, etc., for without a defense, they run the risk of falling prey to the accusation of being another _dreaded_ _faith_. Atheism (at least certain strains of atheism), therefore, may entail the very concept that it champions against so violently. The atheist can no longer claim the intellectual “high road”. The floor seems to falling out from underneath the atheist. Sadly, and strangely, without the atheist even noticing.  Maybe some philosophy would help.

I don’t understand the “want” for an idea like The Many Worlds Hypothesis. Every possibility, actual, in reality. Even if this is true, why would anyone want to “know” this? Why would you want to discover things to be this way? Well, maybe, that’s the wrong question. The question is not simply about personal preference, it’s a bit deeper, though a very subtle distinction, it’s about caring about Truth to begin with. Why care about Truth? These sort of ideas, about the origins of things, that are being pulled from physics are not things that “help” us. There is no practical purpose for these ideas, it is for the love of the Truth. Well, why is it that we want to know if the Many Worlds Hypothesis, or something like it, was true? Why would we want to know this? Why would a person argue for something like this? Again, why does the Truth matter so much, with such a disregard for the consequences? Why does Truth take priority?  Why is it the highest value? The reason people retreat from physics, into “finance”, is not because the universe described by physics is “more beautiful” than we ever imagined. It’s because the Truth may be something we don’t _need._ Where are we getting this idea of “beautiful” from anyway? From our brains, that are a random accident of the unguided process of evolution? We are supposed to think that our brains, which were developed by the universe, assuming the universe is not itself a created act of intelligence, is somehow the judge of what’s “beautiful”? What about the consequences? What happens then? So, you think the Many Worlds Hypothesis is “beautiful”? A portrait of reality that says that everything we do is for nothing, because we do _all_ things, is beautiful? _Why do I find this view repulsive, while others are spending their lives, the only life they believe they have, arguing for something that diminishes themselves and everyone else into nothingness?_ How does that make any sense?  How is this beautiful? How does the diminishing of humans, of us, allow for the universe to become a more beautiful place? This is a nightmare, yet they don’t see it. Maybe I am just too sensitive.  HA!  But, still, it seems that we are for nothing. We are digging our own graves, happily. We are all doing _nothing,_ at every moment, if an idea like this is true. If an idea like this is true, we are all playing a game with no rules, no winner, no structure, no reason. Who would want to play such a game? If we could somehow step outside of this world, and I invited you to play this game, the sort of game that I believe the Many Worlds Hypothesis is, it would seem that no one in their right mind would want to play this game. Beautiful? You don’t know what “beautiful” means, then.  You are using this word in such a foreign way that I no longer follow what you’re saying.  “Beautiful”?  No, disgusting.

[Oct**1**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/928/ "October 1 2015")

Ruse says that he takes Christianity “seriously” because it is a “grown up answer to a grown up problem”, i.e. why is there something rather than nothing? I think Christianity is a joke. God DOES NOT equal Christianity. THIS misunderstanding is why the debate is not moving forward. Ruse says that the existence of God is not something that overwhelms his thoughts. I think that God should overwhelm his thoughts, all our thoughts. Ruse dismisses Dawkins, rightfully so, but he does not cut enough fat out of the equation. He is seemingly content with meaning and not Meaning, because I think that he does not understand the consequences of meaning, with a lower case “m”. He rejects the “humanistic” response that attempts to develop objective meaning, and he’s right here. But he does not seem to understand that the lower case “m” in meaning has dire consequences. Life becomes a boring, nonsensical, absurd sort of existence. Existence does not have any “ultimate grounding”. It seems that everything is simply a brute fact or a product of chance. Both of these distinct answers seem ludicrous. God, as an ultimate reality, provides some “rationality” to everything. I don’t think that thinking of God’s existence of a “brute fact” rightfully captures what God is. Although, the thought of existence, any kind of existence, theistic or atheistic, makes me dizzy. Why does Christianity need to be the “future” of anything? Philosophy and theology is what moves us forward with regards to God, nothing else. Christianity is not what moves us forward. Christianity, and religion in general, is what holds us back, since religion is something that needs to be squared with the knowledge we develop within the subjects of philosophy and theology. Why can’t MORE people disconnect the concept of God from Christianity? We do not need to “know” the purpose and direction intimately, like the sort of answers that Christianity attempts to give, in order to proclaim _there are_ Purpose and direction. I may not know God’s purposes (how could I know such a thing?), but using philosophy, I can come to comprehend a slight glimmer of what God may possibly be, which would entail a general purpose, maybe better put, “rationality” within the world. How does Ruse have all these feelings of accomplishment or “lack of regret” when looking back upon his life, when he only has subjective meaning? It doesn’t make sense to me why Ruse is“content” with subjective meaning. Subjective meaning alone leads to absurdities.

Peter Millican says that he is a “skeptic” rather than an “atheist”. He thinks the traditional theistic conception of God is most certainly false, but the “strange things in the universe and what might exist” is another question. This sounds in accord with my line of thought. Is atheism diminishing? Are atheists rejecting such a small part of the picture?  It seems that the number “1” may be contingent. Why or how would the number “1” exist, without God? A necessarily existing abstract object seems nonsensical. God, as a mind, seems to be the source of all being, including these abstract objects, which seemingly exist necessarily, but are actually contingent in the sense that these abstract objects only exist because God has decreed it so. How could God _not_ be necessary? An immaterial being seems to be the only sort of thing that could exist necessarily. Numbers imply rationality, rationality is the only thing that could “create”. Mathematical objects just existing, for no reason, doesn’t seem to make any sense.  God makes sense of many things.  God may have to make sense of all things.

People do not go to a place of worship in order to worship properly. They go to help themselves. They go to seek refuge in a misconception of God. No one wants to _understand_ anything. People want comfort, not understanding. People don’t want real answers, people want comfort. It’s not that there aren’t any answers, necessarily, but rather that the answers are hard and painstaking. No one wants this. People want _**SIMPLE SALVATION.**_ Maybe I want this too. Maybe I don’t.  

Both atheists and theists are to blame for the stalemate. The atheist thinks that by giving anti-religious arguments, she is therefore refuting philosophical proofs for the existence of God. This is incorrect. The theist needs to engage the atheist on common ground. The atheist, almost all atheists, after attempts to refute a particular theistic argument, will resort to the “Even if” response, concerning any particular theistic proof.  This is the last ditch effort for the atheist to maintain her claim of rationality, or the  accusation of the theist’s irrationality.  It goes something along these lines: “Even if the argument shows that there was some kind of cause/designer/moral absolute/etc., it does not prove that the God of the Bible/Quaran/Old Testament exists.” Alright, then, we can all agree on this.  Let’s all agree on this. Atheists take a step forward and theists take a step back. Lose the misconceptions of God. Atheists, stop rejecting God __along__ with Religion’s god. Theists, stop embracing Religion’s god. Atheists need to stop pretending they know more than they know.  In other words, the atheist needs to rid herself of this false sense of humility. They also need to understand what their worldview actually entails.  The theist, this person, needs to stop trying to shove the “round” God into the “square” hole.  The conversation can’t seemingly move forward until this happens.

I am looking to philosophy for answers. I am not looking for an academic standing. I am not looking to impress. I want to _know_ things. I want self-discovery, more than anything. Am I doing everything wrong? I feel sick about this and I feel sick about changing it. Ha! Explain that to me, please? Why do _all consequences_ make me nauseous? Nothing sounds good to me. I don’t want this and I don’t want that. I don’t want that particular that, or this particular that. I don’t want any of it. None of it. What do I do then? Every decision is awful. Freedom? This is a value? Ha! Freedom!! We want anything but freedom. We are not creatures of freedom, we want to be in bondage. Freedom is the curse of man. What do I do with all this freedom? There’s too much, it’s everywhere. Freedom has me seized. I cannot move. I am frozen. I am a Boltzmann Brain. That would make more sense than anything else. All of nature is Infinite, necessary matter. A Boltzmann Brain without knowing it.  How is it that _this_ makes more sense of the insanity I see around me? Freedom. I want to feel free. Oh, I just saw it. Right now. Why someone would want freedom. How do I see what I see then? Do I have ultimate freedom? What does that mean? Why do people want this?! Do you understand we are all forced to live up to nothing? Go ahead, try your hardest. No one is watching. Ha! Do you understand?

You cannot tell me this isn’t real. This is as real as anything, if nothing is real. If no one is watching, then every reality is true. There is no objective. There is nothing. This state of consciousness that I am in right now is real. Just as real as any other. Divinity or tricks? Are these feelings a glimpse or a delusion? Last night I thought I saw “truth” though too. I woke up not much shaken by it. I have seemingly lost almost all memory of the Truth. Guess it wasn’t such a big deal after all. What about tonight’s insights? As pathetic as ever? I see either deeper into the truth or farther from reality. It cannot be a middle ground, due to these experiences. It’s too steep a difference. It’s all or nothing. Whenever I think “this is pathetic”, I think about how pathetic it really is. Does this make me feel better? Describe this feeling! It cannot be pathetic, because life is already the most pathetic joke it could be. Nothing is dumber than life itself, not even the small intricacies we call our lives that make up this “life”. Our lives are the joke., We are a joke inside a bigger joke. The big joke is so much louder than all the small, little jokes. The small, little jokes cannot even be heard over the roar of the “big joke”. Everything goes. It’s all insanity if everything is for nothing. And I mean nothing. How do I decide what is true? It either all matters or nothing does? This isn’t a little here, a little there. We live it or we don’t. We do it all the way or nothing. This isn’t a negotiation. It’s God. Always God. THIS FEELING IS REAL. THIS IS ALL REAL. _THIS_. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE. I DON’T MEAN THERE AREN’T PHILOSOPHERS, THEOLOGIANS, SCIENTISTS, AND SO ON. I MEAN, EVERYONE, AT ALL TIMES, ISN’T TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THESE BODIES, ON THIS PLANET, IN A GALAXY, IN A UNIVERSE FOLLOWING LAWS, these eyes, these hands, these words, these sounds, these lights, this taste, that feeling…

I don’t know what else to say. How is it all a joke? Because everyone is not talking about it. We have created everything to keep busy. **STAY BUSY**.  About to ask  the question: “what are we doing he…” Baseball! Sports! Shut up! Death is not coming! Keep me busy! I have a phone call! I love you! I am hungry! I want something! I need something! You need nothing. You need to know why you are here. If for nothing, then death happily awaits. Find out God is real- Kill oneself? Find out God doesn’t exist- Kill yourself? I can’t make ANY decision! Ha! Do I have an extra sense that no one else sees? Even people who talk about life all the time are seemingly insane! Making up stories! Making up religion! I like fast, classical piano. Shred guitar, for the same reason. Why do I like these things? Is simply “liking” things like classical music a sufficient condition to label someone as smart nowadays? Ha! Maybe it is. Maybe only certain minds can handle this sort of thing. I can say this without being accused of being a narcissist, since this pleasure is of no doing of our own. It’s luck, genetics. But, if we value Mozart as a musical genius, and some don’t appreciate him as such, then maybe the people who do, are on a similar level as such a genius. It makes sense that most people do not like classical music, do not play chess, do not study philosophy or science, do not do math, do not worry about life, have children, get married, live a dull life. They live such a consistent worldview, when it’s spelled out like that. What a grand concession of nonsense!! Yet, it’s so hard to see. I have just recently seen it. It’s so much harsher than it even seems. Because almost everyone has it wrong, if I am right. They don’t even know it, but they have it wrong. If something matters, if God exists, so many are so far from where they need to be. If everything is not recognized for what it is, if we do not question tradition, then we cannot even start the conversation. We all need to agree that everything we are doing is wrong, in some sense. Hats, jerseys with other people’s names, strangers names, on them. What are we doing? Ha! But, then again, people paying to watch another person play classical piano is pretty ridiculous too. It’s all so ridiculous. It’s just that simple. There isn’t any funny language. I mean this with all sincerity- This is all ridiculous. Clapping, standing, kneeling, stop! Ha! What are you all doing? Sit down and stop clapping. It’s robotic. I can’t believe anything matters at this point. What do I do with this? I don’t see God right now. I feel further away than lately. People TALKING about problems?! Ha! A bunch of “high power” people standing up for a guy with a small cap on his head ramble off a list of obvious problems with the world and saying they need fixing? What? Am I missing something? What kind of world is this? Take off your stupid hat and do something. ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. Preaching is not doing anything. Is your part simply to draw attention so the masses can take over and relieve you of your personal responsibility? Is this “worth it”? You’re tricking us, to save yourself, but in order to get to the highest good. People were impressed with hearing about the problems of the world and no solutions. What am I missing? Please, tell me! What am I “seeing” that no one else sees? It’s almost like another dimension. But not “out of body” type dimension. I am still here, but I am just seeing another “layer” in the mix. It’s a thicker layer. Let me try this and see if I am missing something. “Hey, Pope! Great job listing obvious problems with the world and not telling us how to solve them or what you are personally doing to solve them!” I could have given that talk. I could have listed problems I see with the world. Why is this is seen as a DISCOVERY to the rest of the world? THIS IS IMPORTANT. IS THIS WHAT I SEE? IS THIS A REAL EXAMPLE OF WHAT I FEEL? The world doesn’t see the “problems” I see, so when the pope states them, it’s like they are having water thrown in their face. Ha! This can’t be true. But if it is, it’s a good example of what I see. I don’t understand how or why. I need sleep.

Am I scared of everything? Or just God? Is failure scary? Why did I think “failure” and get scared?  Why did I think “God” and get scared?  Why do I feel the same fear for both terms?

I would like to present another voice into the conversation too, Michael Murray. I would like to say my piece. But I am not smart like this guy. Or are we just smart in different ways, about different things?  Why isn’t everyone struck with such an overwhelming sense of self-doubt?

There are videos that once you see, you can never “unsee”.  I am not sure people know what the world is actually like until they see videos like this, what people are capable of.  Maybe watching these videos I am only getting a small sliver of the reality of the situation myself.  If that’s true, then I could not handle the situation, I could not handle the reality of life.

If I take my tests and pass them, then what? I have to _do_ something. But what do I do? How do I do it? I feel frozen. I feel a weight on me. It’s hard to describe. I am lucky I am even moving. I could be laying in bed, never moving.

Abstract objects. I misunderstood Craig. I was looking to see how he could still maintain Truth within math and morality, yet be an “anti-realist” concerning these things. The answer about morality or mathematics and their truth was in the fourth lecture of his Caderbury talks. He says that the first premise of the “Indispensability Argument” which states that for any X to be true, there must exist at least one X. So, for 2=2 to be true, there must exist the number two. Craig does not “refute” this first premise, but he shows that the one is _not rationally compelled_ to accept it, since the adherence to this premise would make many or most of our everyday language turn out to be something we don’t intend it to be. For instance- “Hattie is beautiful”, when I say it seems true to me, no matter whether “beautiful” exists in some abstract realm or not. The Ontological Commitment to the existence of such abstract objects, Craig argues, is too strict, and therefore we have reason to be skeptical that it is true.

**Is this the approach of all philosophy or just Christian philosophy?** Plantinga, Alston, Rea, Craig, etc. all use arguments that cast doubt on a particular premise or assumption in order to “sneak” in or “not completely rule out” their ideas. Plantinga does this with “free will” and showing that the “quasi-logical” principles of God being able to create a world without evil or always being able to prevent it, aren’t necessarily true, therefore there isn’t a logical problem. Alston differentiates between the concepts of perceptual knowledge and religious experiences where he gives a “story” about how it could be possible that religious experiences, if judged by a different criterion than perceptual knowledge, since religious experiences are different sorts of experiences than perceptual experiences, then the religious experience would be _on the same sort of grounds_ as perceptual knowledge, in the sense that it would be “weakly justified”, yet still unable, like perceptual knowledge, to refute the skeptic. Rea does a similar thing with skeptical theism and our lack of knowledge of particular “goods” and “evils” and their logical entailments. Craig is now using this same technique by showing that the assumption of ontological commitments is skewed and need not be adhered to due to some seriously unwelcoming and almost absurd consequences on regular language sentences. They never show their position, they simply, as Mackie talked about concerning Objective Values, they find “companions in guilt”. And by showing that their, religious or theistic, beliefs are no worse than any others, even without a strong positive case for their theistic beliefs, they maintain that they are rational in holding them.

I like that I was able to learn a little bit the last couple of days. You want to remember? Make a list of the things you learned, outside this journal. The last few days I understood a new problem facing skeptical theism and I learned how to be a antirealist, in the ontological sense, but a realist in the sense of Truth or semantics.

**If the premise of the indispensibilty argument is true, then the statement “Aristotle = Aristotle” is false, since there is no object that denotes “Aristotle”. Craig thinks this is obviously absurd, and therefore it is rational to NOT accept any sort of criterion that has such strict ontological commitments.**

Kierkegaard was right.  The earthly concerns that bother us, once they disappear, with the help of other earthly concerns, one gets lost in the mess again. One gets back into the usual, the familiar. One gets sucked back into what everyone else is doing, saying, thinking. The only reason I may be embarrassed about thinking about the things I think about, are because everyone else finds it “strange”, because they are caught up in their earthly situations. They are all lost.

The Stalemate-

The theist needs to get rid of religion. The atheist needs to keep a particular conception of God, while still rejecting religion. The conversation gets caught in the mud since the theist is trying to cram their theistic version of God into what we find in the world. They are taking ancient religions, from ignorant people, and instead of rejecting the older attempts to understand the divine, they are trying to drag the old ideas along for the ride. The theist needs to drop this old conception of God. The atheist realizes this point, but then unjustifiably, rejects all concepts of the divine. This is wrong. The atheist and the theist need to meet in the middle, realize the philosophical arguments for God are good, or that they point towards some sort of “ultimism” that we need to talk about and develop.

Depression and religious experiences may be the same thing. If I need to discuss “religious experiences”, then this ought to be easy. I could simply discuss the feelings that I have become all too well aware of.

When I look around the world, does it look purposeless because it is, or because all humans have gotten it wrong? Are humans not concerned with what’s important?

It’s okay for me to feel nervous. I will be fine. I can write about things. I can think about things. I know a bit. I will be fine.

I want to understand! Not an empty type of understanding either. Not a scientific understanding. I want to know “why?” Why are we so afraid of “self-delusion”? I don’t get it. What does it matter if we are deluded? If it’s all for nothing, then why not? Even Grayling doesn’t see it. He is a philosopher and he still is arguing about religion and not philosophy!!! This is insane!! You’re an expert talking on these subjects? How? How?!?! Eliminating religion does not eliminate God! People are “leaving religion” and feeling “free” and “happy”? They are leaving RELIGION, not God. They don’t even know the God that they are leaving. They are leaving a phantom. Of course this disgusting conception of God ought to be happily rejected. We cannot leave the absolute though. The absolute is here, always. The moral law. The creation of any and everything. They are leaving PEOPLE. People are religion, which is why religion is awful. Why do I want to talk to a fool? To any fool? People are following these dumb religions, others are rejecting the wrong God, both are saying the complete opposite thing, yet both are completely wrong. Working for humanity? Ha! God could care less. It cannot be about morality. Then anything goes, and I can’t be upset about greed. Maybe I am just mad about their inconsistency? They profess to be “moral”, yet aren’t. If they were admitted nihilists, then acted greedily, this wouldn’t upset me. Am, or was I, feeling the same sort of feeling for theism that I had for atheism a few years back? Am I only interested in the theistic side now? Am I not really listening to the atheists anymore? Is this for good reason though?

You try to say that we cannot know the possible reasons that God may have for allowing such evil. He, creating free creatures that work towards His divine plan, may have to allow for suffering in a such a way as we perceive it, in order to come to the “end” or goal of this divine plan. We are in no way able to have such a knowledge. But why did WLC use the example of all the intricacies that led to the allied forces winning the war on “D Day”? God picked a side in a petty human war? God would want “us” vs “them” mentality? Huh? This is ridiculously stupid, to think of God in this sort of way. Maybe Christians are WAY more wrong about God than I thought. Christians are concerned with HUMAN affairs, not with God. God is the red-haring. Just as Kierkegaard was concerned with _his_ “infinite happiness”, his concern over his eternal happiness overpowered his concern for God. Reading Kierkegaard, I lost track of God. I was brought into THE HUMAN. **This is not God, this is CHRISTIANITY.** Christians are not concerned with God, they are concerned with themselves. They are concerned with _their_ eternal happiness. They are selfish. _This_ is why they follow conventions. This is why they are concerned with tradition. With stupid outfits. With stupid movements. Stupid rituals. This is not worship, not proper worship, because _these_ things are not concerned with God. God is a mask. Christians are hiding behind the mask. It is all wrong. All religions are all wrong for _this_ very same reason. Am I being too harsh? Am I being dogmatic here? It just doesn’t seem right. There is something off about it all. People are animals. They are all similar. Like all dogs have breeds. Humans have breeds too. They all fit into boxes. The same way particular breeds of dogs all have similar characteristics, so do humans. And these similar characteristics differ from breed to breed in humans just as they differ in dogs. What kind of God is concerned with us? With _us_?! It’s not the “smallness” of US. Rather, it is US. It’s what we are. It’s the kind of creatures we are. We cannot be God’s purpose. This is obscene and disgusting. To think, the perfect being, concerned with us. Ha! Beyond delusion. Maybe this being is hiding from us. Maybe this being is laughing at us. Waiting for a better creation to arrive. This is possible. I cannot see this species, my species, as special. We are not special. This isn’t real. This is a simulation. Life cannot be real, in any sense of the word.

William Lane Craig, you are concerned with yourself. You did not respond, IN ANY WAY, to the writer of the “best”, most “popular” letter ever written to you? This is how you _respond_? Unreal. Even if you didn’t personally respond to me, a courtesy letter of some sort would have been nice. A “keep us posted”. _You faked interest in me, the same way you fake interest in God, for your own self-interest._ You know less about God than anyone, considering you’re supposed to know a tremendous amount more than most people. I am left with this sort of “choice”. It may not be possible to “believe” just anything. But there must be a way, no? Are pragmatic _defenses_ not pragmatic _reasons_? **Do they only justify, and not compel?** Why don’t they compel me? Compel me. I cannot align my life with theism, because I do not see it as true. I do see an “Ultimism”, but I do not see “value” in this concept. I see something that I cannot perceive. It’s not materialism. It is other worldly, that has nothing to do with value. VALUE is concerned with humans. HUMANITY IS WRONG. GOD IS NOT VALUE. Oh, no. This might be it. God cannot be value. God cannot be perfection. God is “lost in a trance”. A disembodied mind is not “value”. There is no “value” in this sort of being, in this sort of existence. Why is Christianity wrong? Because it is concerned with value. Values are concerned with humans. Humans are therefore concerned with humans and human affairs, rather than God. Christianity is not correct, nor is any religion that is concerned with value, since this would put emphasis on the human, rather than the divine. The divine realm, cannot be anything of value. It’s kind of existence has nothing to do with pleasure or pain.

Is this my escape from responsibility? Is everything permitted, regardless of God’s existence, since God is not the god of christianity, but rather a true God. _**The correct conception of God cannot be engulfed in humanity.**_ This is why when I read Kierkegaard, I didn’t find any answers, I found disgust. I was left feeling dirty. I was left feeling cheated. That writing, at least, is not who I thought you were. Human, all too human, is right!!  Nothing matters, again. Even if I believe in God, I am not left with anything. I am left empty. With a small sense of relief, but I am not exactly sure why. I don’t feel I will live forever. _**When I think of God’s existence, and what could possibly be “mine”, when I die,**_ _**I think of it as**_ _**a spiraling, swirling black abyss of different colors, somehow spinning forever in nothing.**_ What kind of existence is this? A disembodied mind? Nauseating, isn’t it? Am I left with nihilism? Is there a particular purpose that may “satisfy” me, without me being able to actually know what it is? Could that be enough? Just knowing that something is “ultimate”? Do I spend the rest of my time attempting to figure out what this Ultimate is? _**If I think human beings got it “wrong” with almost every thing else I see around me, why would I have so much trust that they would get the most important question correct?**_ _**HA!**_ What was I doing all this time? I was following tradition. I am not an atheist. No one is an atheist, because we are all wrong. All religious people are wrong. Even me. Of course there is an Other. We atheists are revolting against the phantoms. How silly it has all been. Can we move on now? Can we open our eyes? Can we stop taking these narrow roads of “naturalism” and “theism” and actually have a conversation, rather than an argument about things we do not know, yet have such a burning desire to know? I hope to read this and agree with it, tomorrow.

I have religious experiences. I do. They just aren’t like the ones religious people describe. Ha! Mine are overwhelming, seemingly (according to this journal) impossible to put into words, and come swooping in like a vulture. They are not under my control. It’s like “seeing a tree”. I simply see the tree. I simply “see” these experiences. They are all too true to me. I am seemingly observant. I am seemingly perceptive. That’s all. Is it possible to see what I see, and believe something positive? Is it possible to believe these things, be a nihilist, and believe in a God? Not the Christian God, we already hold that Christianity has a false conception of God. God is the creator. God is the Ultimate of anything that there actually is. I am having trouble squaring God as not being perfectly good. I am going to watch perfect being theology videos now. Schellenberg thinks that a “religious ultimate” has to be metaphysically necessary, axiologically insurpassable, while having a relation to us humans in a positive way. Theism is a part of ultimism, but ultimism is not necessarily theism. Nietzsche or Kierkegaard have it right. One of these two seems correct. Do I agree with what Schellenberg says or did I think these ideas up on my own? God is the SOURCE OF ALL BEING. If there is such thing as “value”, then God would be the ultimate reality pertaining to value. God is value, since if ANY REALITY EXISTS, IT EXISTS BECAUSE OF GOD, EVERYTHING FLOWS FROM GOD. _BUT,_ DOES A MORAL REALM EXIST? I am not so sure if a moral realm does exist. IS GOD GOOD? God’s aseity is what is important here. Maybe God is the creator of everything, yet morality is just a human INVENTION. Is my sense of morality real? Is what I feel about morality similar to my sense of perception? I can’t tell if it is real or not. Is it objectively real? How do I figure this out? Is this the sort of thing that Kierkegaard is talking about, when making a decision about something that is objectively uncertain? Or is this maybe more a Jamesian “forced, live, and momentous” sort of occasion?  Are we rational to hold that objective moral values exist, for pragmatic reasons?

**HITCHENS/DEMBSKI DEBATE- 1 HOUR, FIVE MINUTES IN.** All of this ASSUMES that there IS a standard of goodness. WHY ARE WE ASSUMING THIS? What if “good” is an invention, not a perfection? Why could not God, the creator, be AMORAL? Mackie’s Error Theory? There are no objective moral values. Even if God exists. Is there an objective moral standard? If there is a God, then goodness would FLOW from God. But, we also have to question if Good even exists. Actually, our moral intuitions, if we are created by a God, then evolution maybe would be the reason for why we have sentiments and morality, but evolution would be a result of a design plan, a purpose, from God. Therefore, our moral intuitions would seemingly be as TRUE as any other sort of epistemological claim, e.g. sense perception, etc. On a theistic worldview, God would make sense of our MORAL INTUITIONS, that the intuitions relate to something REAL, that actually exist. On evolution, moral senitments could still be explained, but they would end up being inventions that do not relate, metaphysically, to any object/s. BUT, CAN I BELIEVE IN INVENTED MORALITY AND GOD? ARE THESE IDEAS CONTRADICTORY? VERY IMPORTANT. Does God have to be “good”? Could, theistic evolution, produce beings with sentimental/moral intuitions, that are ultimately unjustified/invented/groundless? Is this possible? If it is not, then if I think that particular arguments for the existence of God make it probable, then I have to believe in morality, that morality is real. Since God, a perfect being, creator of everything, would not create a falsehood. The falsehood being moral intuitions that do not relate to anything in reality. Why would God create creatures with such a concern for morality, if morality is not real? If there is no Good? God would have to be the good? The good cannot be “beyond” God, one of the horns of the Euthyphro dilemma, since God is the creator of everything (divine aseity), and therefore God would be the standard, God’s nature is the Good. Would this necessarily mean that there is a particular way to live? Why think that? Objective values do not have to run into direct, specific events, e.g. it’s not that monogamy is moral and polygamy is immoral or vice versa. It may be a more broad sort of value. Caring for anything and everything. Loving everything and anything. Renouncing the anger. Renouncing the stress. The RELEASE of it all. The “religious” or “ethical” life, which I am using interchangeably, unlike Kierkegaard, is not a “struggle” or difficult to achieve. It’s living a life of God. God is the good, so we live the life of the good. A life concerned with God. God is not concerned with petty anything. I am not sure if this is the same thing as studying, but it seems to be working with my stress levels. I need to reread this tomorrow. Human beings don’t need to be seen as “exceptional” or a special part of creation. God could have created everything, morality could still be real, but as Schellenberg has said with regards to “deep time”, humans are early on the scene and there is a lot more to go. Human beings do not need to be the “end” or “goal” on God’s plan in order for morality to still exist. Humans may not be “completely” special, in that we are not the total end of God’s plan, but if God existed, and His nature was the good, we would still be bound to the moral law, to God. Do the arguments for God make His existence more probable than not? If the arguments do make His existence more probable than not, then it seems that theistic evolution, which has developed a moral sense within creatures,is something that would be better explained as “real”. It would not be a made up invention, for _simply_ or _purely_ survival. It would be a _development_ from evolution that helps with survival, which allows for creatures to “grow” and maybe develop a better understanding of God and the universe that He created. Morality would be real, but not demanding. Morality would not be for OUR END, It would be for His! Morality is not invented, if God is real, but it is also not ultimately concerned with humans. Petty “moral” decisions, that are all too human, are not morality. **I need to figure out if my moral intuitions are something that are groundless.** By why would God create anything, i.e. a universe with sentient beings?

[Sep**29**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/815/ "September 29 2015")

It’s getting late. I am tired. I am sober. My feelings make me feel like I am both dying, yet like I am seeing everything in its most true form. Why do my different states align, yet not compel? What if depression is not something that ought to be cured?  What if this insight, that is depression, allows me to see reality in it’s most robust form?  What if I need these thoughts? Why is this a bad thing? Am I afraid to embrace God because I am afraid that the only cure I could possibly imagine may not work? If God doesn’t “work”, is that it? Is that the end? Is medicine worth it? Would I be conscious of deluding myself with pills? **Depression helps me see things as they are in themselves, I think. Ha!** Don’t censor. Don’t “think”. Write things. Write what you want to. There is no audience, just me. Your laugh tonight, sir, was so slow. Not only was it delayed, but it was almost like you were laughing in slow motion. You have to be a robot. There’s no way you can drive, your reactions times must be horrific.  I can’t tell which of my feelings are correct.  Does this make me lose all credibility? Credibility to who? Am I just typing everything I am saying in my head? Well, yes, but not JUST that. I have to be typing something more than what I am thinking. I have to stop. I am not sure I can deal with this right now. I feel a very strong sense of panic.  I don’t want to feel like this ever again. This isn’t the good part.

Watching people speak makes me nauseous sometimes.  They all seem so silly. Even the man in the middle. This gay, doofy, tall theologian. He is just sitting there with a condescending smile the entire time, whenever Atkins speaks. And with good reason. But why doesn’t Atkins see this and get upset? It looks like the undercover gay man is listening to his five year old daughter talk. He had kids? Ha! I don’t want to end up like these people. Talking to talk. They talk with such confidence about things that neither can obtain in this world. I feel that one side sees the issue too clearly (theists) and they overreact. I think the atheist miss the train and under react. There is a “middle ground” that isn’t agnosticism. Schellenberg, I think, has a pretty good grasp or view that would fit this middle ground. I had such a great thought when I was eating pizza in Vegas. It was a Jamesian/Kierkegaardian sort of thought. Why haven’t I read Kierkegaard in my philosophy of religion book? Why wouldn’t I read something that is “so important” to me? How lazy can one person be? Why am I scared to leave what I hate the most? Why am I scared to leave my comfort that is anything but comfortable? This can’t be my fault. It has to be my brain. My back hurts or I would keep typing. I am going to read instead.

[Sep**29**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/811/ "September 29 2015")

I am here writing some more. I have some thoughts that need to be let out. I am super critical of everyone, but also of myself. I am always questioning myself. When I forget about depression I get complacent. Why is this? There is no sense of urgency anymore. I am left with The Nothing. Just a pile of junk. Sitting, standing, eating, sleeping, thinking, drinking. Why does this not stop? What is going on? I am concerned with losing my mind. I am pursuing insanity. I am looking forward to the breaking point. When I am “calm” and able to “enjoy” life, _this_ is when I am in the most trouble. Kierkegaard was right. Thinking you’re “better” is the most dangerous position. To not be cognizant of Life, allows for wasted time. I am going to write myself into acting properly. I am going to write myself into living properly. I am going to write myself into doing what makes me happy. I think if I sat down with these people I would ask them if they “feel” what I feel. Do you feel this? How do you stay focused on anything for an extended period of time? How do you dedicate your life to something, wholly? Is this even a conscious decision? Is this something that you wouldn’t realize until it was pointed out to you? Do you not find this strange? How do you not get hit, like a ton of bricks, with the worthlessness of it all? Is it even a battle? You couldn’t come face to face, look it in the eyes, and then simply ignore it. This is not something that is “shaken off”. This is an incurable disease. Or so I think. I also think there might be one cure, but I have come to question whether God is such a cure. MAYBE THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCE THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH IS THE SAME TYPE OF EXPERIENCE THAT A RELIGIOUS BELIEVER HAS. WHAT A RIP OFF! I want their feeling, their experience. I want to not be able to “shake” THAT feeling. What ecstasy it must be. WHAT IF ALL MY EXPERIENCE ARE TRUE UNDER THIS PERSPECTIVE? WHAT IF I AM JUST SEEING THE BEST THAT ATHEISM HAS TO OFFER? WHAT IF THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE? WHAT IF MY EXPERIENCE IS “NEGATIVE”, IN THAT I DO NOT EXPERIENCE GOD, DIRECTLY, BUT I FEEL THE UTTER LACK OF GOD. MAYBE I AM FEELING THE COMPLETE ABSENSE OF THE PERFECT BEING. This would make sense. But, then, I am still confused about how many people do not or cannot experience what I experience, yet believe in God. The simpleton does not believe in GOD!!! Your idea of God is not God!!! Your pleasure is a stolen one! It is a false sense of security. You need to understand what it is like to be without God before you can appreciate Him. Here is some consolation: I am either doing everything right or I am doing everything wrong.  Would I feel any guilt from the theistic lifestyle? Would I feel this same emptiness? I don’t know, I have to live it. But to live it, I need to take that leap. I need to live it, experience it, embrace it fully. I need to be ready for that. I need to fight off the boredom. Boredom of everything. Life seems to be what people tell me heroin is. You can never re-live that first high. You are left chasing a phantom. **Naturalism** _**is**_ **chasing phantoms**. Keep reaching. Keep striving. There isn’t anything there for you. You are alone, utterly alone, surrounded by humans. How does that feel? Do you not know? Then God is not for you. You are not worthy. You don’t believe correctly. Why is this a surprise? It seems that humans have almost everything wrong. Look around the world, it’s disgusting. Arguing over human matters. Over made up fictions, such as money. Over power. Power? You don’t know what power is. Your power is laughable. You are a deluded little child who thinks he can beat up a grown up. Wake up, wake up!! Go ahead, realize you have it all wrong. Realize you haven’t thought about anything over most of your lifetime. This is sad. People get outraged over strange things. Think about why you are upset or angry. The first republican debate was gross. If you have to ask “why”, then you’re not alive. You have no idea what’s going on around you. You are happy. I know you are. Your life is going “just fine”, I know this. But I know something you don’t know. That your life is an illusion. But, is an “illusion” all that bad? I am not so sure anymore. What is the obsession with conforming beliefs to “reality”? Socrates? How about living instead? Hedonism is no good? A smart pill? How about a dumb pill? How about lowering an IQ. Camus was never more right than any other philosopher ever. Once you are aware of the absurd, however one wants to define it, you will not outlive it. It’s there. It’s here. Now. And now. It will never go away. This needs a response. Camus wrote a book about what I am writing, because people sometimes do feel this way. However, this dramatic, serious take on the question is stupid. _THIS_ is what I mean. Even what I am writing is stupid. People write all the time and don’t think this, why does it infect my brain? Did Camus think about how pathetic he was? Most likely not. I am “better” than Camus? Maybe, HA!

I am able, I think, to hold a conversation with a professor of philosophy in his area of expertise, when it is not my area of expertise. I actually think I know more about him than he does about particular things. Why is this surprising? He can’t know everything. He knows logic, I know philosophy of religion. I feel that he does something similar to what the New Atheists do, which is that he is ignorant of particular things, but particular things that are extremely relevant to his position. So, in order to firmly hold your own position, without running into inconsistencies, which is what I believe most do, you need to know these other perspectives, but these other perspectives are banned from the Naturalistic worldview. Strange. I feel like I need to write because I feel that I have important things to say. What important things do I have to say? Oh, I don’t know. I am not sure if I have to do anything. Do I need to put away my laundry? Why? Do I need to clean my desk? No, I don’t think so. I can get along in my day fine without doing these sorts of things. I am going to do the exact opposite. I am going to lay down. I am going to nap, but not really nap. I am going to enjoy the sounds, not get distracted by them. I am going to feel the breeze from the fan, but not let it control me. I am going to lay there, that’s it. I don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to pursue something. This world is not set up for people who change their minds. People are expected to pursue one thing with much vigor. How do they stay motivated? Is it because they don’t have my thoughts? My feelings? Nap time, maybe. I don’t want to study anymore. I want to talk. I want to have a discussion about things. I want to hear other perspectives against mine. I want to be told I am wrong. I want to be shown that I am wrong. Please.

Why is everything always the opposite for me? Marriage, kids, job, religion, etc. Anything that is customary, I revolt against. Why do I do this? Is this what my life has become? Do I find life so boring, that in order to receive even a trace of excitement, I need to make things as difficult as possible for myself by going against the grain, for not really any good reason, as far as I can see. Why do I do this? What is the point of it? Why does my brain not find contentment in what most others do? I want to go relax. That’s what I want to do. I want to feel TRULY relaxed. I don’t remember what that feels like. I sort of know I have had to have felt it before, but I truly cannot remember when that was. I just want to feel normal. If someone else could experience what I experience, when they got back into their own bodies, would they think I was dying? Would they find it as uncomfortable, in every way, as I do? Would they think something wasn’t right either? Am I making these decisions? Who is doing the thinking here? Who is this? Am I or is someone else making these decisions? It feels like there is an “auto-pilot” that takes over when I daze too far off. That keeps me balanced and going until I really kick back in. It doesn’t feel like a conscious thing. In fact, the opposite. Can I please relax tonight? I think I am in too deep. I am not sure how to stop. It seemed like it was sort of on the fence, but now it’s becoming powerful. Almost taking control. How do I go from a bad “weekend” to a good first day back at work? Oh, impossible. That makes this week ruined. An entire week of my life ruined, before it has happened. I have to have fun. I have to go out. I can pass out on a chair for all I care. The anxiety makes it awful. The anxiety is stopping me from enjoying this. Enjoying myself. Go away. Leave me alone. Let me live, if even for just a few moments. Just let me feel decent. DECENT. Relaxation, please, find me. I can’t even type comfortably. This is insanity.

[Sep**29**](https://paralyzingnihilismblog.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/810/ "September 29 2015")

I don’t want to forget what I have experienced this year. I have gone from bad to worse, from smart to smarter, and back again. I have no idea what to do. I can’t be vague with my writing here, because I may not have the same perspective, when I reread this tomorrow. This is the problem. I need to figure out which perspective is true. Are there contradictions between my perspectives to where I could only hold one at a time? I wanted to believe in God, maybe I needed to believe in God. Did the arguments persuade me? Did the depression make this happen? The depression makes everything so thick. It’s like walking through a world of jello. Everything is slow and obvious. It’s like a major league baseball player’s fastball gets put on a tee. But, then, you wake up. You understand what you were thinking before you “woke up”, but it doesn’t have its hands around your neck the way it did the night before. It was like you were in a straight jacket. It’s not: “where did the jacket go?”. It’s: “who undid these straps for me?”. I don’t think I want to experience these feelings again. But I definitely don’t want to forget them. They are powerful. They seem too powerful. But why is everything so clear and yet so foggy. I feel that I understand everything and nothing. I want to tell the world and I want to hide in the corner. I want to be spectacular, but I don’t want to be known. How do I renounce everything? How do I commit and live like others do? Are the others who seemingly make this brave journey only able to do it because they are dumber than I think they are? Is this my narcissism? I feel that I hold a rare quality that most people do not. I see things in the way people talk, write, move, etc. that I feel others do not see. If I live the theistic life, would that be enough? Would I really believe it? I feel that very few people believe what I believe or think the way I think. How could I possibly be surrounded by people with these horrible theistic beliefs. The pathetic, common, idiotic sayings and thoughts about the divine. It’s sickening. Is it only I who sees the conflict? Saying “I believe in God” is such an empty phrase. Why can’t anyone else see that they are living life like it is meaningless, and yet are happy? Why can’t they see what I see? That you need to live a different sort of life, a life of God, if you are going to proclaim to believe in God. This world cannot proclaim the existence of God, base moral values around this God, then not act in a coherent relation to these values. Bankers, greed, capitalism, etc. These are all against God. You are not thinking of God when you ignore that homeless man in the street. You are not thinking of God when you buy a $300,000 car, when that money could have saved possibly thousands of lives. You are not thinking of God when you are dogmatic about anything. You are not God. You are not omniscient. You cannot be dogmatic in your beliefs. If you were thinking of God, you’d be thinking of omniscience, and as a result, you would not be able to be dogmatic. I want to think of God. How does everyone not see the spectacle that is life? The flashing lights, the loud noises, the droning speech. What are you all doing? What are you all talking about all the time? Not God? Then, what? Nothing. You speak of nothing. I don’t want to be tested. I want to be talked to. You want to know what I have to say about something, then talk to me. Let’s have a discussion.  You know facts. I know DEPRESSION. I have seen things you have never seen. This is not crazy. I know this because I DO NOT see them, when depression takes its nap. IF I DO NOT SEE THEM, HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SEE THEM? This is why I have grown, leaps and bounds, in the last three years away from school. I have never been more miserable. What do I have to be miserable about? That question, when asked to me, proves that the questioner has not experienced DEPRESSION. DEPRESSION is as close to me as any family, friend, thing, etc. Nothing is closer. It is real. It has developed a strange insight that makes my brain capable of seeing things that I cannot seem to get into words. It’s an unspeakable feeling that lets me know what I am thinking is right. What I am seeing is clear and right. The way I see Swinburne and think that he probably never thinks about how dumb _this_ is. He talks with such authority. HA! It’s like he cannot even question, or come at it in that mindset, because he does not have depression. Everyone takes everything too seriously. I don’t mean that, but I can’t put that feeling into any other words for some reason. When I watch debates, I see people who are “experts” say things that just a few, solid nights on YouTube would have prevented the ignorant slips. Why don’t they do this? What else are they doing? They are going out into public, to speak in front of people, with that kind of hubris, without knowing some pretty basic things? Why did my Professor not know that people have denied that 2+2=4? Why had he not come across anything in metaphysics or philosophy of mathematics? Why did I have to explain the ideas of WLC to him concerning the moral argument? Why did he not get the ontology of values? Area of specialty- ancient Greek philosophy. Nothing else, I guess. Where does he get the idea that he can teach this? However, he speaks clearer than me. In a more calm manner. Is what I am saying making sense? Are they too confident, when they shouldn’t be, that they speak without a stammer due to not trying to process every word before it leaves their lips? Is what I am saying correct? Let me think _this_ 3 times before I say one word. Why couldn’t I teach, if he can? Why do people want to speak, when they are not sure? Why am I so critical? My biggest fear is to say something stupid, yet my professor lived my fear, to me! That’s crazy. I read his email and immediately thought “how could he say that?”. I do not want to forget my depression, it is my best friend. How do you kill your best friend? It has been my best friend since my father died. Is this a pathetic excuse or is there some legitimacy to this? Is it a little of both? How do I determine the truth? What if I like being depressed? Even if it led me into suicide eventually? Would this be a bad thing? No, it is not necessarily. I think this “vision” of life has it’s moments. A very _**lonely**_ sense of superiority. A “sense” that you cannot show to anyone unless they have this sense too. You cannot show a blind person the color” blue”. You cannot show a person “life” who doesn’t have the depression. You have not seen it. You don’t know what you’re even upset about. I am upset for you, because you don’t see that you’re upset about the wrong things. **I am telling you what you’re upset about is meaningless. That’s upsetting!** I will write what I feel. Are you upset about something human or are you upset about the “human condition”? If it’s the former, you’re a fool, you do not see anything. But then may I laugh at myself? Is the “human condition” the ultimate joke? Is the acceptance of the “ultimate joke” the cure? A complete collapse? No, it can be this, too simple. The human condition is both entirely objective and entirely subjective. It is wrongheaded to say that you cannot be “upset” about the human condition, because this is self-refuting. I don’t care about my writing sequence, and neither should you. Listen to what I am saying, not how I am saying it.**Don’t retain facts, envision** **concepts.** Anything less is pathetic. I am going to write until I have nothing left to say. Do I let someone read this to get a different perspective? Why am I doing this? I might have to believe in God. If this is the case, then I need to live the religious life. Not of the masses. The atheists were always weak, extremely weak. The theists always sounded strong and confident. Why are they shunned? What is the motivation for not wanting God? What is the pursuit of Truth even mean, without God?_**Self-deception, I welcome it. Open arms. I am here. I need it. Without it, it’s eventually going to catch me again. This is not something to be beat. This isn’t a “human” fix. There is only one fix- God.**_

I will re-read this. We get mad at God. We reject God. Like almost every other facet of life, humans have gotten it wrong!! You don’t get married and fight urges, you don’t pop out children for no reason but because you think that’s what you are supposed to do, your money means nothing, your relationships could possibly mean nothing, you reject the WRONG God. God is not what we were taught growing up in the west. The human race is a first grader, sitting in on a course on metaphysics, and then being expected to come back and teach it to his first grade class, or to anyone for that matter. It’s going to come out, at best, awful. There are going to be so many wrong paths that are taken, and always straying farther and farther from the truth. _This is your God, atheists! Reject him, please. But, believers, shame on you, since this is your God too._ You are more like the first graders in the classroom listening to the first grade “professor” lecture on metaphysics. You are fools. You ruin it, or at least make it extremely difficult for us. The same way people get deluded into worshiping sporting events, you are as equally as pathetic for the type of god you worship. You are disgusting. Yet you seem the most happy. The most calm with the condition. Why? Because you are ignorant of the condition. The same goes for people who believe in god because it got them out of drugs or a bad spot? Nope, that’s not God either. You are concerned with drugs, not God. You were using drugs for the wrong reason. You weren’t trying to escape the human condition, **depression was not your friend,** you were upset for _human_ _reasons_. This is insignificant. You do not know what to properly be upset about, so you can not properly believe in God, because you have not had the experience of depression. “Oh, it’s not that bad.” That, maybe, is the entire point!! Ha! Everything might be worthless, and not that a specific act is depressing, doing particular actions or things, but the “truth” that even any action is nothing. Even the closest people to me, I don’t believe they have what I have. They don’t have depression.

So, like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, the depths run low, real low. This is were you find the truth. This Truth isn’t in a textbook. This Truth isn’t in a test tube. Subjectivity is all there is, in the most fundamental sense. So, what do I do now? I mean, how could I have been so wrong about Dawkins? How was that possible? To not be able to see that the entire New Atheist movement is based on the false ideology of verificationism. Why is that so obvious to me now and not then? Why can’t _they_ see it? The motivation for hating God was my father. This made me not want God to exist. So, having the wrong conception of God, it was easy to be mad and reject this being. But then how did I find _this_ God, the Truth? The Depression. What a strange path. And it’s not over yet. Where do I go from here? _**HOW DO I ACT? WHAT DO I DO?**_ Why can’t I just DO what I am supposed to do? What am I “supposed to do”? I feel that I should be living different. Why can’t I align my life with a theistic constitution? FULLY caring about other things. Nothing matters but helping. Giving up concern, rather, giving up CONSIDERATIONS that do not pertain to God, TV, movies, art, human expression. Is this too harsh? Am I giving up too much? Am I losing all subjectivity? Shouldn’t we all be talking about God all the time? The universe all the time? Why we are here? Who or what put/got us here? How is driving off to work in an impressive tin can, not caring about your family, worrying about your money, cheating on people, impressing people you do not know nor will ever know, something that describes many human beings lives and is accepted without any sort of kickback or scorn? How is this acceptable? Don’t judge me. Don’t look at me like that. Do not argue with me, you don’t know what you’re even saying. Never mind what I am attempting to say. You are getting upset about the wrong things. Don’t step over that homeless person. Do not ignore that homeless person. You just spent $15 on a coffee and sandwich. You ARE responsible for them. But don’t worry, this isn’t as daunting as it sounds. We are ALL responsible. Your part just got cut to a 7th of a billion or something like that. I wish I could speak the language that is mathematics. That would be something. It would be like being able to play classical piano, or speak intelligently on philosophy!! I do have a talent! Useless to all, but not to God!! But, then, I must be crazy, because most of the world, if not almost all, are then fools. How could God allow this? This would seemingly be pretty awful.

I am scared to take my tests. I want them to talk to me. I want them to discuss with me. I don’t want to show how much I have learned or know, I want to learn what I DON’T know, what I am ignorant of. I want to pick their brains. Do I have to show them I know the material in order to warrant a conversation? No, of course not. The conversation will be dictated by my ability to give good reasons for what I am saying. Why do I have to show what I have learned, when I know it. Who am I showing it to? You do not know I want to teach this stuff. I WANT TO KNOW IT. Don’t test me because I am going to be held to some standard after graduating because my philosophical views will somehow be taught to other people. You should be testing me on my philosophical conclusions to make sure that I go out into the world with the most “correct” views. Because although I may not teach my views, my views will reflect in my behavior which will directly effect other people. Fuck what Kant said. What do I think about the existence of objective moral values? What do I think about what life fundamentally is? If I understand any worldview well enough, then I think it would have less negative consequences on society. I would not be upset if my wife decided to leave me, since life is meaningless. Sounds contradictory, but as a consequence of the knowledge of my worldview, I would be less motivated to go out and do “immoral” actions. Why not, if life is meaningless? Because depression slows everything down, remember? I may kill myself, in the _right_ mood, but I do not want to hurt other people, due to the “clarity” of my worldview. Maybe I am more clear than I thought. Or I am clueless. Who knows?

I am surprised no one responded to my two comments on WLC’s Facebook page. Did they not understand what I said? I felt that it was pretty controversial coming from the person that the entire post was about and…nothing. Very strange. I feel more calm now. I want to think, yet not study. I want to retain information, but not study.

I feel strangely better. Maybe having all the thoughts ramble my brain around all night like a game of football is not such a good thing. Seems pretty obvious: get out thoughts, feel a little relief. I still need to figure out if I should, and how to figure out the “if” (live it, experience it, reason my way through) live the proper way. The ways of life I have in mind, atheistic and theistic, are polar opposites. They cannot both be true, yet one must be. One has to be. I will include advanced intelligence into the theistic worldview. Any intelligence. But theism or atheism. One or the other. One way seems “difficult” to live, even though I do not know “why?’ since it seems that atheism only has one benefit- DEPRESSION. Ha! A benefit, indeed. It let me see a lot of new things, without ever leaving my room. But the theistic life would seeming be difficult to live, yet produce the most happiness. It is the ONLY way to True happiness. All the rest is just a game. All the rest in a “simple” illusion. A stupid trick. A poor magician. What’s the fear of duping myself into something that I believe would make me ULTIMATELY happy? How could I express this to another person? How could I get someone to see this? Do religious people see this? Or do even any “intellectuals” see this? I don’t think they do. They wouldn’t go along with tradition. They wouldn’t be so sheepish. Even the people who believe out of despair or for pragmatic reasons, may get it wrong. I AM NOT SPECIAL, I SIMPLY HAVE A RARE SENSE THAT I FEEL FEW POSSESS. A DEEPER THAN COMMON CONSIDERATION FOR “BIG QUESTIONS”, COMBINED WITH THE CLARITY AND SMOTHERING OF DEPRESSION. **IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND “SMOTHER”, YOU ARE A SHEEP.**People pay to escape reality because they see it as something bad? I escape a “bad” reality for something worse- True reality, in all its glory. Like someone shining a flashlight directly in my face. I can see.

I am almost afraid to read this journal. Should I read this journal? Should I let someone else read and comment on it? I may have nothing to say. Maybe I do though. Depression has been me. I am not wanting to go to therapy because I cannot rid myself of my depression. The void is too big. I would be erasing myself. I need something to fill that void. God would fill that void. Maybe this is why I am not ready yet. I can’t do therapy with someone who doesn’t understand. I need to make a “leap”. _The chasm between depression/suicide and God is big. Depression leads me to God. The more I rid myself of depression, before I am ready, the farther away I am from God. I need to be fully depressed, in order to find God, yet I cannot be in the true grasp of depression while believing in God. How do I get out of this?_ **THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.** I feel the complacency setting in again. I need depression. I need to be depressed. “Extra-sensory” depressed. Then when the choices are only God or death, God must be chosen. I am asked to jump with no legs. I am asked to climb with no arms. HOW DO I TAKE THIS LEAP? ESSENTIALLY, HOW DO I LIVE?

I am almost done. Why sit around and think when you can sit around, think, and WRITE?

Sometimes just talking to people makes me dizzy. I can’t even get a word out. I go blank.

The best part about all of this, that makes everything so true, is that all of you sheep can post anything you want, all over the place, no matter how pathetic and stupid. Yet, if I post this, my thoughts, I would be seen as “strange” or “off his rocker”. This is sad. This is the reason depression only has one cure, and it’s not human.
